<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is more than a story to inspire children with
a desire to relieve suffering; it is a simplified and handy
reference book, telling what to do in cases of accident or
illness. In no sense is it intended to take the place of
the physician. The first principle of first-aid cannot too
often be repeated—<i>when in doubt, send for the doctor</i>.</p>

<p>Especial thanks are due to E. A. Y. Schellenger, M.D.,
member Surgical Staff, Cooper Hospital, Camden, N. J., for
his great assistance in verifying and revising the medical
and first-aid instructions given herein; and to Constance
Cooper Crichton, Instructor of First Aid Classes, New
Jersey Women’s Division National Preparedness, whose
helpful criticism and suggestions have been invaluable.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Head Nurse, Miss Bossem, rushed out
of the Dolls’ Hospital toward the children.
“You’re late, Miss Helpem,” she called to
Mary Frances. “Go right on duty rolling
bandages for the soldiers who start for
Mexico to-day. The troop-train leaves at two-thirty.
Hurry, now, or you won’t get them to the station on
time.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Billy, “Get the ambulance ready
immediately,” she commanded, and Billy disappeared into
the garage.</p>

<div class="spaced">··········</div>

<p>You see, Mary Frances finished the course in First
Aid Nursing with the Red Cross Preparedness Class just
before her birthday. Being very proud of her newly
acquired knowledge, she wanted to show Billy how much
she had learned.</p>

<p>When Billy promised her any favor she could think of
as a birthday present, Mary Frances joyfully asked him
to spend a whole day at the Dolls’ Hospital in the playroom,
pretending they were little kiddies again—that she was
Miss Helpem, the assistant nurse, and that Billy was the
ambulance driver. To keep his promise, Billy consented.</p>

<p>Just as they stepped into the playroom door, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
seemed to grow smaller and smaller, until they were no
bigger than the dolls themselves.</p>

<p>Now, go on with the story and see what happened.</p>

<div class="spaced">··········</div>

<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Always Carry This With You</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>Promptly at two-fifteen, Miss Helpem arrived at the
station with an ambulance full of bandages, and just in
time to see the Brave family bidding good-bye to Private
Ima Brave. All the family were there, even Michael, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
big bulldog. Private Brave was among the last of the
soldiers to board the little train.</p>

<p>“You’ll write from New York, dear,” begged his mother,
kissing him for the twentieth time, and slipping a little
American Red Cross first-aid outfit in his hand. “Always
carry this with you, and remember how your mother loves
you.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll send me picture postcards from everywhere,
won’t you?” begged little Ibee Brave, standing on
tip-toe to get a better view of his tall, straight brother.</p>

<p>“There’s a speck of dust on your uniform,” fussed Soami,
his little sister, as she brushed him with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Private Brave smiled. “We’re not on dress parade,
little sister,” he said. “It’s good that khaki doesn’t show
the dust, for it’s a dusty country we’re going to.”</p>

<p>“‘It’s a long, long way to Mexico, it’s a long way to go,’”
began little Ibee; but at that moment the engine whistled,
and his father clasped Private Brave’s hand.</p>

<p>“I am proud of my son,” was all he said.</p>

<p>“And I, of my brother,” Shesa, his big sister, added,
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>One more whistle, and the little train started down the
playroom railroad track.</p>

<p>“We’ll bring the limousine nearer the station,” said
Mr. Brave, taking Mrs. Brave’s arm and walking away.</p>

<p>“Father and Mother don’t want anyone to talk with
them just now,” said Shesa.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. Gee, I wish I was big enough to go,”
said little Ibee, as he watched the train until the last car
turned a curve in the track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d make a fine soldier, wouldn’t you,” laughed
Soami, “when you’re afraid to go upstairs in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Only sometimes,” answered Ibee; “only when the wind
blows hard and when it’s not moonlight—and then, not often.”</p>

<p>“Why, Soami, Ibee is real brave,” said Shesa. “Don’t
you remember how you were afraid to go down cellar to
get some jam last night and Ibee would
have gone, if father hadn’t made you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and father stood on the landing
the whole time you were gone, too, Miss,”
declared Ibee triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” acknowledged Soami.
“I guess Ibee would make a good soldier—especially
a drummer boy. My! he can
drum bravely! Did you hear him yesterday,
Shesa?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did,” laughed the sister.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Soami, mischievously,
“don’t you remember the verses about—</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Speeders’ Accident</span></small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE shrill sound of a policeman’s whistle cut
the air three times, but the dollsmobile sped
on faster than ever.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t catch them at all, at all,”
reported the little thin sub-officer, McStoppem,
at headquarters.</p>

<p>“Bring my motorcycle, McStoppem,” ordered Chief
Arrestem.</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” nodded Officer McStoppem, bringing
out the wonderful little toy. “If you take the cross-cut
road toward Sandpile Village, you’ll catch them. The
number is—here it is, I wrote it down—1492. You can
easily remember it—the year Columbus made ‘preparedness’
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Cut out your chatter, McStoppem, and follow me in
a hurry,” directed the chief, as he kicked the pedal of the
motorcycle to start the engine. “Hand me the paper,”
and, snatching it, was off.</p>

<p>“The chief’ll get ’em O.K.,” muttered Officer McStoppem
to himself, as he watched the long line of dust and
smoke in the wake of the little motorcycle.</p>

<div class="spaced">··········</div>

<p>Just as Chief Arrestem came into the cross-roads leading
to Sandpile Village, the runaway automobile flew past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“By Jiminy, I don’t wonder McStoppem couldn’t catch
them,” he said under his breath, as he put on still more
speed. “That man’s lost control of his car, and unless I’m
mistaken there’ll be an accident when he comes to that
dangerous turn in the road where that big rocking chair
stands.”</p>

<img src="images/i-024.jpg" width="419" height="312" alt="an accident" />
<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Oh, the Engine’s on Fire!</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile everybody in the dollsmobile was trying not
to be frightened.</p>

<p>“Can’t you slow down a little, Father?” asked Mrs.
Brave.</p>

<p>“The brakes won’t hold,” panted Mr. Brave, forcing
both brakes on with all his might. “This is dreadful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed little Ibee, looking out the rear
window. “Here comes the motor police. He’ll arrest us
for speeding.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy, we’re coming to Rocking Hill road,” gasped
Shesa. “Father, do turn off the power!”</p>

<p>But Shesa spoke too late, and kerr-smash! kerr-bang!
kerr-plunk! went the dollsmobile right into the rockers
of the rocking chair, turning “turtle” twice, and breaking
the beautiful glass windows to pieces. Out of the broken
radiator the boiling hot water poured over poor Mrs.
Brave’s arm where she lay just as she was thrown.</p>

<p>“Oh, the engine’s on fire!” shrieked little Soami, “and
I’m burning to death!”</p>

<p>“Father, Father,” called little Ibee, “come get me out!
I’m fast under the car! Come get me out, please! Oh,
I’ll be burned to death! Father, oh, my arm hurts! Oh,
I can’t move my arm!”</p>

<p>The mother managed to get up when she heard the
children call.</p>

<p>“Where’s your father? Oh, where is he?” she cried,
and going to the other side of the car, she saw poor Mr.
Brave lying amidst a heap of broken glass and wheels and
gears. From his head ran a little stream of blood.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s dead!” she sobbed, but just then he gave a
little groan. “Oh, my dear husband,” she exclaimed, “tell
me you’re not dead! Tell me you’re not dead!” she begged,
unmindful of her own arm.</p>

<p>“I’m dead, Mother,” groaned little Soami. “I just
know I’m dead with pain.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not!” said little Ibee, “and even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
my arm hurts so, I’m going to try to go for help if I can get
out from under this car.”</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Up Came Chief Arrestem</span></div>
</div>

<p>“My, that’s so!” exclaimed the mother. “I myself
forgot to be brave. I’ll go for help.”</p>

<p>But just as she spoke, up came Chief Arrestem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw it all, madam,” he said, “and I stopped to
telephone to the hospital for the ambulance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ’rest us, please,” begged little Ibee. “Please,
Mr. Officer, don’t arrest us. We weren’t speeding. Father
couldn’t make the brakes hold!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, little chap,” replied Chief Arrestem.
“I won’t arrest any of you. Here comes Officer McStoppem
on his motorcycle, just as I told him to, and in a minute
we’ll have you all out from under.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about me,” said Ibee. “Please get poor
Soami out. She’s dead, I think.”</p>

<p>“Quick, McStoppem,” called the chief, “help throw
sand on this car to put out the fire!”</p>

<p>It took about ten seconds for the two officers to put
the fire out, and even before that, they heard the honk!
honk! of the ambulance.</p>

<p>“Here comes the ambulance!” cried Chief Arrestem.
“Now, with the driver’s help, we’ll soon be able to lift this
car.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“NOW, all at once,” directed Chief Arrestem.
“One, two, three!” and the two officers and
the two ambulance men lifted the dollsmobile
high up over to the other side of the road.</p>

<p>“Well, friends,” said Officer Arrestem, “if
there’s nothing more we can do, we’ll return to our duty.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more, thank you,” the
head nurse answered.</p>

<p>The driver had quickly smothered
the flames of little Soami’s frock by
using the automobile robes.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” shrieked Mrs.
Brave, “where’s Shesa? I wonder where
my dear daughter is! Where is she?
Where can she be?” she kept on asking,
crying hysterically.</p>

<p>“Hush! quiet yourself!” commanded
the assistant nurse, who came in the ambulance.
“We found your daughter a few moments ago
where she was thrown. She had fainted, but she is all right
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sit her up; don’t let her lie there!” exclaimed the
mother.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you must keep quiet,” said the nurse, “or we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cannot do anything for anybody. It is better for her to
lie down than to sit up.”</p>

<p>“I’d keep quiet if I knew what to do! Every woman
and man, too, ought to know.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">They Attended the Most Dangerously Injured First</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” replied the nurse, “every person ought to
know something about first aid to the injured.” She and
the other nurse were busily directing the orderly and
driver of the ambulance in every movement, giving them
explicit directions.</p>

<p>They attended the most dangerously injured first,
stopping the bleeding (hemorrhage) of Mr. Brave’s head
and bandaging a dressing in place. They applied soothing
carron oil to the burns on little Soami’s arms and legs.</p>

<p>They bandaged temporary splints to little Ibee’s broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
arm, and, since Mrs. Brave’s scalds were not serious, they
attended her last.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Brave’s broken leg they placed pillows to
make him more comfortable.</p>

<p>“If I’d only remembered to turn off the power this never
would have happened,” he muttered. “How foolish of me!”</p>

<p>“There would never be any accidents to speak of,”
said the assistant nurse, soothingly, “if everybody did
everything right, you know.”</p>

<p>“If everybody just kept his head cool,” said Mr. Brave,
as he tried to move his position, but fell back with a
groan.</p>

<p>“Give him a half-teaspoon of aromatic spirit of
ammonia, Miss Helpem,” said Miss Bossem, who was
engaged in spreading the stretcher.</p>

<p>“Now, everyone ready to lift this patient,” she directed,
as she and the driver and orderly knelt on one knee beside
Shesa, and Miss Helpem took her position on the opposite
side of the stretcher. As the three lifted Shesa, Miss
Helpem carefully held the stretcher in place, and afterward
helped carry the patient to the ambulance. Next they
carried the two children, using a stretcher for little Ibee,
and making a two-handed seat for Soami. (A “sedan
chair,” you know—the kind you play with at school.)</p>

<p>“I’m sorry neither doctor could leave the operating
room to come, Miss Helpem,” remarked Miss Bossem, to
her assistant, who was Mary Frances, you remember. “If
you will wait here with these two patients,” (they were Mrs.
and Mr. Brave) “I will return with either Doctor Surecure
or Doctor Quickenquack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, why can’t you take my dear husband along?”
begged Mrs. Brave. “He’s awfully hurt! awfully!”</p>

<p>“Please explain to her, Miss Helpem,” said Miss Bossem,
getting into the ambulance, “that it is far better to wait
for the doctor to attend a broken leg than to attempt to
place it in splints—unless it is absolutely necessary to move
the patient.”</p>

<p>Miss Helpem turned to Mrs. Brave, who was by this

<p class="drop-capi">IN a short time Mrs. Brave began to feel
better, and, by the time the ambulance
returned, was able to stir about.</p>

<p>“Let us have a look at this broken leg,”
said Doctor Quickenquack, examining Mr.
Brave. “Ahem! I think, Miss Bossem, after all, we

<p>Place pillows under the leg to make it more comfortable, but
do not move the patient before the doctor comes, unless absolutely
necessary. If necessary to move, place a board or an umbrella, one
on each side of the leg, and tie in place, (or tie both legs together if it
seems advisable) using bands of muslin, handkerchiefs, or<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>triangular
bandages.</p></div>

<p>“After we have Mr. Brave in the hospital, we’ll put
that leg in the right kind of splints and bandages,” remarked
the doctor, as he and the driver and orderly placed him on
the stretcher. “You’ll be running a race like a boy in a
few weeks,” he continued encouragingly as he seated himself
beside the patient in the ambulance, and the nurse
helped Mrs. Brave to a place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>“Like a tortoise, I’m thinking,” said Mr. Brave, trying
to joke above the pain, for oh, how his broken leg did
ache.</p>

</div>

<p>Clang! clang! clang—clang! sounded the ambulance
gong, and in less than a few minutes they were at the
Dolls’ Hospital.</p>

<div class="spaced">··········</div>

<p>The next, morning little Ibee came into his father’s
room, where his mother was sitting beside the bed with her
scalded arm nicely dressed and bandaged.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a doctor,” he announced proudly, after
bidding his parents good-morning. “This is a dandy place!
There aren’t any private rooms for Soami or me, so we’re
each in a ward, and there’s a fellow in the men’s ward all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
done up in bandages. I just wish you could see him! I
got Doctor Quickenquack to tell me what kinds they all
were and I can’t remember all of them, but I know he said
something about triangular and spiral and figure-of-eight
bandages. My, that fellow looks fine! He has a broken
arm and a broken leg and a dislocated shoulder and a
fractured jaw, and his bandages are swell! He did the
whole thing by sliding off his barn roof last Sunday when
he was putting shingles on it. He says it’s a judgment—whatever
that is.”</p>

<p>“Well, for pity’s sake,” exclaimed his mother, “Ibee,
how you talk! Do take a breath!”</p>

<p>“Hello, everybody!” said little Soami, running in.
“How’s father? Shesa’s fine, Miss Helpem told me. No
bones broken except one finger. Shesa’s asleep now, and
her finger’s bandaged beautifully!”</p>

<p>“Father’s just about as well as can be expected, dear,”
answered their father. “And very thankful none of us are
hurt worse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ibee, shaking his head. “Even
though my arm aches so, I’d have liked to have had something
worth while; for instance, a compound fracture of
the thigh. Father’s was only a simple fracture. In a compound
fracture the broken bone often comes through the
skin, I heard the head nurse say to one of the assistants.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said his father, “if you had this, you’d find
it was enough!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with the boy? Is he crazy?”
exclaimed his mother. “As though we hadn’t all had
trouble enough!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s crazy,” said Soami. “There’s a
girl in our ward who has a broken nose, and it looks too
interesting for anything to see the nurse dress it! I want
to be a nurse when I grow up! Just think how many people
one can help! Why, if it hadn’t been for the nurses, perhaps
we might—nearly all be dead!”</p>

<p>“Indeed we might,” agreed their mother. “I don’t
know whether you’ll be a doctor, Ibee, or whether Soami
will be a nurse, but I do know that I’m going to ask Miss
Bossem if a class cannot be formed in our neighborhood in
which we can all learn how to render first-aid to the
injured.”</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Read it out Loud!</span>”</div>
</div>
<p>“Good for you, Mother,” said Shesa, coming in at that
moment, and kissing her father. “I’ve just been talking
with Miss Helpem, and she has explained how to join the
Preparedness Movement, so that if we should have war
right in our own land, or serious accidents,
we could help care for the
wounded or injured.”</p>

<p>“That brings my dear Ima to mind.
Oh, I do hope we’ll get a letter to-day,”
said her mother.</p>

<p>“Here’s a postcard just received for
Master Ibee Brave,” said a nurse, coming
along with the mail.</p>

<p>“From Ima!” said Ibee. “It’s from
New York,” looking at the postmark.</p>

<p>“Read it out loud!” cried his mother. “Let us all hear
how the dear boy is.”</p>

<p>Ibee read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now, isn’t that brave?” exclaimed his mother. “He’s
as brave as Teddy Roosevelt!”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful to belong to such a brave family,” said
Miss Helpem, who came in just then to renew the dressing
on Mr. Brave’s head.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“COME,” she added, “this excitement will never
do for Mr. Brave. Everybody leave the
room, and everybody go to bed and take a
nap.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” began Ibee. “I
want—” but at that moment, Miss Bossem, who was
passing, came into the room.</p>

<p>“Why, what does this mean?” she asked crisply, gazing
around. “How does it happen, Miss Helpem, that all
these people are in the invalid’s room? Everyone who
comes in must have permission.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am surprised!” exclaimed Mrs. Brave. “As
though I’d have to ask permission!”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Miss Bossem, in a very decided manner,
“everybody who stays in this hospital must obey the rules.
Miss Helpem, will you kindly see that the children are put
to bed, and I will take Mrs. Brave to her room.”</p>

<p>“I’m no child,” began Mrs. Brave, “I’m an older woman
than you, and I’ve had——”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to risk your husband’s life any further?”
asked Miss Bossem, lifting her eyebrows and speaking in a
low, icy tone.</p>

<p>“Poor wife—” began Mr. Brave.</p>

<p>“See!” said Miss Bossem. “He’s already too excited
to rest tonight without some medicine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” whispered Mrs. Brave, “I’m so sorry!”
Then aloud: “Miss Nurse, I’m real tired. I think I need a
nap. Good-bye, dear, I’m going to my room—you take a
nap, too.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Bossem to Miss Helpem, “I did
succeed in making Mrs. Brave see how dangerous it was to
excite the patient, but my, I don’t like to be so cross!”</p>

<p>“I just had to be firm with the children, too,” replied
the assistant nurse. “But Shesa’s a dear, and has extraordinary
good sense. She is going to form a class in Red
Cross first-aid work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll give the instructions,” said Miss Bossem;
“that is, if you are willing.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Miss Helpem, “but what I meant
to tell you is that
Miss Shesa is going
to form a class for
children.”</p>

<p>“What a lovely
idea!” exclaimed
Miss Bossem, passing
on into the
clinic.</p>

<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Can’t I Go, Too, Doctor?</span>”</div>
</div>
<p>“Doctor, I’m
getting quite tired
of being here,”
complained little
Ibee to Doctor
Surecure, when he
met him in the corridor
one day about
three weeks later.
“Of course it’s
dandy to see so many banged-up people, but I’m nearly
well. My arm aches only on rainy days, and I can wiggle
my fingers fine.”</p>

<p>“Good,” smiled the doctor. “I’m thinking myself
that we’ll be parting with some of the Brave family
soon. Your mother and sisters are to leave us Saturday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t I go, too, Doctor? Can’t I?” begged the
little boy.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a pretty way to talk,” replied the doctor.
“Don’t you like us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” said Ibee, “but the fellows miss me a lot,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Why, what will your poor father do without any of
you?” teased Doctor Quickenquack, who happened to be
passing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come see him every day,” said Ibee. “He’ll
love to hear all about home. Can’t I go?”</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over,” said Doctor Quickenquack.</p>

<p>“And if we do decide to let you go,” added Doctor
Surecure, “you must promise not to try to take off your
bandage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I promise,” said Ibee. “Doctor Quickenquack
said that if I let my arm be in it long enough, I’d be able
to play baseball again: and besides, I want to show it to
the fellows.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll not pitch ball for some time to come, young
man,” laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Brave and the children were soon in their own
home, leaving poor Mr. Brave in the hospital. By the
time Mr. Brave was able to return, walking with a crutch,
they had formed three first-aid classes. Mrs. Brave’s was
for grown-up ladies, and of this Shesa was a member.
Shesa herself, with Soami and Ibee’s help, had formed two
others; one for Boy Scouts, and one for Camp Fire Girls.</p>

assistant, “how would it be for you to take
charge of Miss Brave’s children’s classes,
with her help, of course? If you think well
of that arrangement, I will take the adult
class, and leave the children’s
instructions to
you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could
please me better, Miss
Bossem,” answered Mary
Frances (I mean, Miss
Helpem). “I dearly love
dolls—oh, I meant to
say, children.”</p>

the knife or needle slip; if we did not allow little children to
carry scalding hot water or lighted lamps, or to play with

Yes, almost all accidents are avoidable if we think

<p>These little living particles are too small to be seen without a

healing. So you can readily understand how necessary it is to keep
all materials which touch <i>broken</i> skin <i>perfectly clean</i>, and they cannot
be clean if touched by the hands. Neither is any material clean which

<p>Understanding this, your aim will be to keep germs out of any
wound. If you do not have a first-aid outfit, you should have on
hand a small package of sterile gauze.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Sterile means perfectly free
from germs. Any cloth which has been washed and ironed is quite
safe, however, if it has not been used. You see, heat kills germs.
Use next to the wound the surface which has been folded inside.</p>

<p>Do not think that every germ does evil, for some germs are good—just
as some people are bad and some are good. Indeed, we depend
for some kinds of food upon the action of certain good germs. Among
such foods are cheese and vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The disease germs which we dread most in cases of wounds are
the germs of blood-poisoning and lockjaw (or tetanus). They are
everywhere about us, in standing water, air, dust. They cannot do
a bit of harm to the outside of the body, if the skin is unbroken—no
more than a fly can do to the armor of some old knight. But if
they can enter where the skin is broken, they begin to do all kinds
of harm, which sometimes results in months of suffering from
“infected” wounds, and sometimes finally causes the patient to lose
a leg or an arm—or perhaps to die.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Slight Cuts and Pin Pricks</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>The bleeding from a slight cut is never very severe and will
generally stop of itself in a short time. It is best to let a slight cut
bleed a little, as the bleeding carries away the germs which may have
been on the edge of the knife or whatever caused the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Touch slight cute with tincture of iodine;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> or with alcohol; or
vinegar and water, half and half; or salt and water, a half teaspoonful
of salt to a cup of water.</p>

<p>Wrap with clean gauze.</p>

<p>In cases of severe hemorrhage (bleeding) send immediately for
a doctor. Stop bleeding by using pressure above or below wound,
or by bandaging a gauze compress on the wound.</p>

<p>Never give whiskey or alcohol in any form. It makes hemorrhages
worse. See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Reference List</a>.</p></div>

<p>Solution of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) made by dissolving
as much soda as possible in hot water (about one teaspoonful to a

<p>In putting out fire on another person’s clothing, use rugs or
blankets. In throwing a rug on another person, be careful not to
allow your own clothing to catch fire. Let the sufferer lie down and
roll. Stand in <i>back</i> of the rug, and throw from the head downward.</p>

<p>If in a burning building, <i>creep</i> to the door on hands and knees to
avoid the smoke.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Avoid Accidents from Fire</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>1. Children should not make bonfires without the aid of older
persons.</p>

<p>2. Matches should be kept out of reach of small children.</p>

<p>3. Children should be taught to be careful of open fireplaces.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Frost Bites</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>When nose, ears, hands or feet are exposed to intense cold they
often become frost-bitten, turning purple at first. If frozen thoroughly,
they turn waxy white; then no pain is felt, because the nerves
are frozen.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>



<p>1. Keep patient in cold room.</p>

<p>2. Do not warm frozen parts quickly. Instead, rub with snow or
bathe with ice water until a tingling pain is felt; then stop.</p>

<p>If frozen parts are warmed too quickly, “gangrene” may result,
or perhaps the sudden heat may cause—</p></div>

exposure to severe cold will produce itching and burning, and perhaps
swelling and ulcers.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“THAT is all the lecture part of to-day’s lesson,”
smiled Miss Helpem. “Now, for the practice.”</p>

<p>She made a gesture toward Shesa Brave,
who came forward, and together they lifted
before the class the tiny medicine cabinet which Mary Frances’
Aunt Maria had given her for her Dolls’ Hospital.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Miss Helpem. “Yes, we have
everything here, I believe. Girls, you may all come look.”</p>

<p>The dolls—I mean, girls—gathered around the little
glass closet and compared the labeled bottles and packages
with the list given them in the previous lesson.</p>

<p>They were delighted with the beautiful cleanliness of
the closet—its bright glass door and white shelves and
shining enamel frame.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Miss Helpem, “please divide into
groups of two. That will make five groups. We will play
that one girl in each group is the mother, and the other
her child. The child has cut her hand while slicing bread.
Mothers, what will you do? What will be your first-aid
treatment?”</p>

<p>Mary Frances—I mean, Miss Helpem—was delighted
with the girls’ answers and with the way in which they
sought out the iodine bottle, and wrapped the supposed
injury with narrow gauze.</p>

<p>“In the next practice game, the ‘child’ acts as mother
and ‘mother’ as ‘child,’” said the assistant nurse. “This
time the ‘child’s’ clothing has caught fire from a spark
which snapped out of the fireplace.”</p>

<p>The girls laughed.</p>

<p>The nurse smiled. “Girls,” she said, “these games may
make you feel like laughing, but please keep in mind how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
serious the real accident would be, and try to learn what
to do. You will be so much better able to live useful
lives.”</p>

<p>You see, Mary Frances didn’t quite remember that
they were only dolls. Even so, they have served a very
useful purpose if they only teach the readers of this book
some of their lessons.</p>

<p>“Ready, now, for practice,” said the nurse. “Girl
No. 2 of each group is to act as a little daughter whose
frock has caught fire.”</p>

<p>The girls remembered not to run, and “pretended” to
smother out the flames.</p>

<p>“That was so well done,” said Miss Helpem, “that no
one was severely burned, so we’ll merely have to treat for
slight burns.”</p>

<p>The “mother” girl from each group went to Shesa
Brave for carron oil, which she applied on gauze compresses
to imaginary hurt fingers.</p>

<p>Then they reversed parts again, and played the “child”
had frosted her fingers. The “mother” girls rubbed the
fingers with imaginary snow, gradually restoring the circulation
of the blood in the “frozen” parts.</p>

<p>Throughout all their fun the girls acted in a serious,
purposeful manner.</p>

<p>“I’m not so certain that boys would ‘play in earnest,’”
said Miss Helpem to Shesa.</p>

<p>“I think they would,” replied the young girl. “I’m
certain Ibee is just as interested as Soami,” which pleased
the assistant nurse more than I can tell you.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE assistant nurse had very little time for
the next lesson in the boys’ class, so she gave
them only notes in the morning, promising
the practice games at four o’clock in the
afternoon. After telling them of this plan,
she began the lesson.</p>

<p>“Probably you boys have never thought of the fact that
the little pipes and larger tubes which carry the blood may
be broken <i>under</i> the skin,” Miss Helpem said. “When

<p>If severe, after the pain and swelling have lessened, use hot applications,
wringing cloths out of hot water, changing them as they cool,
or use a hot-water bag.</p>

<p>For “black eye,” bathe with ice-cold water, or use cloths

<p>Please remember that it is far more important to prevent

<p>“Please, Miss Helpem,” said Ibee Brave, “there are
two more animals I would like to learn something about.
One is the mosquito, and the other is fleas.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed.</p>

<p>“Not animals, Ibee; insects,” corrected Miss Helpem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“We will not have time to speak at length of the mosquito,
for that would make a whole lesson in itself, but I do want
to say that mosquitoes are the cause of some of our worst
diseases, for they carry disease germs from one person’s
blood into another’s. To destroy them, kerosene oil
should be sprayed or sprinkled or poured on the surface of
any stagnant water; for mosquito babies (wigglers) live in
stagnant (standing) water. Please remember this: one
old tin tomato can half full of water will be an ample amount
to supply a whole neighborhood with young mosquitoes in
a short time, so overturn any old tins you see, just to help
in a good cause.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ibee,” she continued, after a slight pause, “I
will tell you</p>

<p>“I say, fellows,” sang out Ibee Brave, after the class was
dismissed, “let’s go on a hike like any good scouts. Gee,
I wish I were twelve years old, so I could be a boy
scout!”</p>

<p>“We treat you just as if you were one. Let’s go over
to the river bank,” suggested their patrol leader. At the
signal, off they started over the hills of the sand-pile
of Mary Frances’ playroom, coming at length to Painted
River and Looking Glass Lake, on which floated the toy

assistant nurse. “You must have had good treatment.”</p>

Helpem. “And I can understand why you haven’t clean
faces!”</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said the assistant nurse, “after this day’s
happenings, I think we will not need any practice games.
I’m very glad nothing really serious occurred, and that
your first-aid knowledge prevented suffering.”</p>

<p>“Say, Miss Helpem, you wouldn’t mind not saying anything
to the other class about the things that happened,
would you? We might just pass it off without much
explanation, you know.”</p>

<p>The mother of Soami Brave’s chum was
the Guardian of their Camp Fire. The very afternoon that
the boys went hiking, she took the girls of the first-aid

leaves in a cluster, while
Virginia Creeper has <i>five</i>
leaves.</p>

<p>The poison rash is caused by the irritating juices of the plant.</p></div>

flowers,” said another girl. “I really believe I’ve gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
some poison ivy among them. Look, is this the ivy?
It has three leaves.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said Soami. “Please throw it overboard.
You may
have a case of ivy
poison ‘for fair,’
though not everybody
‘takes’ poison.
Maybe you’ll
be lucky.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely
hope so,” said the
girl so fervently
that everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,
don’t
scratch!” warned
the Guardian of
the Fire.</p>

<p>But the next
morning’s class
hour revealed the
result of the day’s
adventures. Two
girls came with
bad cases of plant
poison, and nearly every girl had been sunburned.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the assistant nurse, when the girls
told of their experiences. “Although I’m sorry for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this is really very interesting, for it will make you girls see
the real helpfulness of our lessons. You can very soon
relieve each other of your unpleasant skin irritations, for
I shall give you notes on what to do for—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sunburn</span><br />

<small>(<i>See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Reference List</a></i>)</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Sunburn is the result of exposure to the direct or reflected rays
of the sun, sometimes causing the skin to blister and peel.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>To Prevent:</i></p>

<p>Before exposure, spread over the face and arms, cold cream or
any grease at hand—even cream off milk; or use toilet powder.</p>

<p>Keep the head covered, but have <i>air space</i> between the top of the
hat and top of head.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Never wash sunburn.</p>

<p>Never open the blisters.</p>

<p>Mix a lotion of one part limewater to three parts olive oil (sweet
oil), and apply.</p>

<p>You see, the treatment is very much the same as for burns.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plant Poisoning</span><br />

<small>(<i>See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Reference List</a></i>)</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Poison Ivy and a few other plants cause a rash upon the skin
after contact with their irritating juices. Everyone should learn to
distinguish poison ivy, which has <i>three</i> leaves, not <i>five</i>, as has the Virginia
Creeper (see <a href="#poison-ivy">picture</a> in this chapter). If this poisonous plant were
recognized and avoided, there would be but few cases of plant poisoning.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Do not scratch.</p>

<p>Mop on rash a saturated solution of Epsom salt, or boric acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
or baking soda,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> with a small “sponge” of absorbent cotton, which
is to be thrown away after using. Allow application to dry in the air.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prickly Heat</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Prickly Heat is an itching redness of the skin caused from overheating
the body. It appears oftenest on babies; sometimes on older
people whose skin is very sensitive.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Bathe with a pure soap, as Castile.</p>

<p>Then bathe with a mixture of one part alcohol to three parts water.</p>

<p>Dust, with talcum powder.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hives</span> (<span class="smcap">Nettle Rash</span>)</h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>These itching lumps, which resemble mosquito bites, usually
indicate stomach or intestinal trouble. They seem to appear after
exposure to first, extreme heat; then, to sudden chill. Sometimes
they are caused by certain foods; as fish or berries.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>For the itching, rub with table salt.</p>

<p>Give a cathartic. Citrate of magnesia is excellent.</p>

<p>Then give a half-teaspoon table salt twice a day for two or three
days.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned home remedy is one-quarter teaspoonful cream
of tartar in one-quarter glass of water three times a day, at morning,
noon and evening, for three days.</p>

<p>If hives persist, see doctor.</p></div>

<p>“Did you have it all planned to give us this lesson.
Miss Helpem?” asked Soami Brave, while the girls bathed
their sunburned faces as directed, and treated the poison
ivy rash with the Epsom salt solution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>“Do you really want to know?” asked the assistant
nurse.</p>

<p>“Please tell us,” they begged.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth,” replied Miss Helpem, “your
needs seemed to require this lesson so much—that I didn’t
have to invent a game at all—I just put you into practical
practice.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Helpem,” suggested Angie, “would
you mind not telling the boys’ class about what happened?”</p>

<p>“I promise secrecy,” said Miss Helpem. The girls
wondered why she and Shesa Brave laughed so heartily—they
didn’t know that the boys had been given the same
promise.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">TWO boys were absent when the class met for
the next lesson.</p>

<p>“How disappointed I am,” said Miss
Helpem. “This is the first time anyone has
missed a lesson.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Tom and Jim will come late,” suggested
Ibee Brave, and just as he spoke steps were heard.</p>

<p>Ibee opened the door and in came the two boys. Jim
was holding a handkerchief to his nose, which was bleeding
profusely.</p>

<p>“He didn’t want to come in,” explained Tom to the
nurse, “but I told him you could make it stop. He said
he didn’t believe so, for he’d tried everything. He kept
saying he ought to lie down, and I kept saying he ought to
sit up to keep the blood from flowing so easily.”</p>

<p>Tom stopped to take a breath. You see he had great
confidence in Miss Helpem’s first-aid help ever since his
experience with his “black eye.”</p>

<p>“You were right, Tom,” said Miss Helpem, showing
Jim to a seat before the class. “If you do not mind, Jim,
I will give the boys their lesson now on what to do for—</p>

<p>4. Sniff ice water and salt up nostrils. One-half teaspoon salt
to a glass of water.</p>

<p>5. Place a piece of ice under the upper lip. Hold ice, wrapped
in cloth, on the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>6. If bleeding still continues, use a small piece of absorbent cotton
as a wedge or plug or cork.
Fasten a thread to the cotton—to
be used to remove
it. Dip it into peroxide of
hydrogen, and push gently
into bleeding nostril with a
pencil.</p></div>

<p>Shesa Brave
brought the articles
needed as Miss Helpem
worked, and in a very
few seconds after the
nurse had used the
cotton wedge, Jim’s
nose stopped bleeding.</p>

<p>It was an excellent
lesson for the boys,
who didn’t realize that
the next day they
would only be dolls,
whose noses may break,
but not bleed. Still, if you can remember what to do, those
dolls will never mind.</p>

<p>After Jim took his usual place Miss Helpem continued
the lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me see,” she said, “I think, after nosebleed, perhaps
the next most common complaints are earache and
toothache and a few other little aches.</p>

<p>“Now, as to—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Earache</span><br />

<small>(<i>See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Reference List</a></i>)</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>This dreadful pain is generally caused by hardening of the wax in
the ear from cold. <i>To prevent</i> wax from hardening, use a little
common <i>red</i> (unbleached) vaseline in the ear.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Hold ear over a cloth wrung out of hot water on which is sprinkled
some pure alcohol.</p>

<p>With a medicine dropper, drop into ear some warm olive oil; or
saturate a small piece of absorbent cotton with the warm olive oil,
and place in ear—cover with dry cotton.</p>

<p>(Mothers often use one drop of laudanum in the olive oil, but
laudanum is too dreadful a poison for children to handle.)</p>

<p>For watery discharge after earache, it is best to see a doctor,
but a sprinkling of boric acid in the ear will usually relieve the trouble.</p>

<p>If earache recurs often, see the doctor.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Insect in the Ear</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Toothache</span></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>As soon as possible see a dentist. There would be but little
toothache if children were taken <i>in time</i> to a good dentist. This
applies even to <i>first teeth</i>, for if first teeth are neglected, the second
teeth are affected.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>If the tooth feels long, with a throbbing pain, there is trouble
with the nerve. Paint gum with iodine, being careful not to
swallow any. For painting, use a small ball of cotton
twisted or tied fast to the end of a toothpick. Never
dip the used cotton back into the iodine.</p>

<p>If the tooth aches, look for a cavity, clean out
the cavity with a toothpick.</p>

<p>Fill cavity with absorbent cotton wet with essence
of peppermint or red pepper water or oil of cloves, and
cover with dry cotton.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Splinters</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Be careful not to break splinter; pull it out from
direction in which it entered.</p>

<p>If no end appears above the skin, open the skin
with a needle, <i>but dip the needle into alcohol first to kill germs</i>.</p>

<p>Every medicine closet should contain a splinter extractor or
tweezers. They cost from five to ten cents.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hiccough</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Hiccough is usually caused by indigestion.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>A few soda-mint tablets are generally helpful.</p>

<p>Nine or more swallows of water without breathing is a good old-fashioned
remedy. So, also, is holding a deep breath.</p>

<p>If hiccough continues, mothers usually give children a cup of warm
water in which is dissolved a half teaspoon mustard powder—to cause
the child to “throw up” whatever is causing trouble in the stomach.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, I see some of you shuddering,” laughed the
nurse, “and no one can blame you, but sometimes hiccough
becomes very serious, and it is better to take the nasty dose
of mustard water than to endanger the heart’s action from
hiccoughing. But just to console you, I will give some
hints as to—</p>

excellent.</p>

<p>Soda mint is good.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chills</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Chills usually show that a person is going to be ill. See a
doctor.</p>

<p>Never cool off suddenly. Do not sit down in a cool, breezy place
when in a perspiration. It is very dangerous and has caused many a
person to “catch his death of cold.”</p>

<p>If a person becomes chilled from exposure:</p>

<p>1. Use hot-water bags (or stones or bricks, heated in the oven)
or hot stove lids or flatirons, covered with paper or cloth to prevent
burning the patient. Place them under the arms and at the feet.</p>

<p>2. Rub the patient’s limbs toward the body.</p>

<p>3. Give hot coffee or tea or hot lemonade.</p>

<p>4. Keep well wrapped.</p>

<p>5. Give a hot foot bath in which is a teaspoonful powdered
mustard.</p>

<p>6. Wrap in blanket and put to bed.</p></div>

<p>Fainting is caused when too small an amount of blood flows to
the head.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>To Prevent:</i></p>

<p>Oftentimes, bending the head forward until between the knees,
spreading knees apart, prevents a person from fainting, for the blood
then flows to the head.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>To restore a person who has fainted:</i></p>

<p>Keep people away. Patient needs air.</p>

<p>Lay patient flat on floor with no pillow, having fresh air in room.

<p>Hold household ammonia or smelling salts to nose.</p>

<p>Dash a little cold water in face.</p>

<p>Coffee may be given after patient recovers consciousness.</p></div>

<p>“That is all the lesson for to-day,” said the assistant
nurse, “and you’ve all been so attentive that I would like
to give you a reward.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that we need any reward, Miss Helpem,”
said Tom Holden, “when you’ve done so much for us all,
already. Gee, you make me feel like being a doctor when
I grow up!”</p>

<p>“I hope not all of you feel that way,” laughed Miss
Helpem. “A doctor in a town full of doctors would have
a difficult time making a living.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any harm in a few proper celebrations,”
said Tom. “What’s Miss Helpem’s idea, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>By the time the class assembled all the boys had heard
something about “Miss Helpem’s Fourth of July idea,”
and there was an unusual air of expectancy as the assistant
nurse came into the class room carrying—what do you
think?—a toy pistol, a bunch of tiny firecrackers, a bunch
of medium-sized firecrackers, and some “giant cannon”
crackers. Of course, they were very tiny, just the right
size for Mary Frances’ dolls. The “cannon” crackers
were like the tiniest real ones you ever saw.</p>

<p>Miss Helpem had just laid them all on the little glass
table near the little glass medicine closet, when Shesa
Brave came in carrying a little cannon—which would
really “go off, if loaded.”</p>

<p>The boys certainly were surprised, for they thought they
were to hear these very toys condemned.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, boys,” smiled Miss Helpem, straightening
her cap. “This is to be a very interesting lesson. It’s
our Fourth of July lesson, even though the Fourth doesn’t
come until next Tuesday. I hope we are all going to have
a grand time on the Fourth. The girls’ class have planned
their part in the town event. Doctor Surecure is in charge,
you know. He is planning a civic and patriotic celebration.
I shall ask Miss Shesa to read you the program. You will

<p>“Some program!” commented Tom Holden.</p>

<p>“But why not let us have firecrackers and toy pistols?”
asked Ibee Brave.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Helpem, why not?” asked half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“I am prepared for that question,” smiled the assistant
nurse. “If you will kindly open your note-books, I think
by the end of this lesson you will understand that it is not
because anyone wishes to deny you fun that you are asked
not to use these little toys,” pointing to the table, “but
because—well, after you have heard the lesson, I think you
will know something about the danger from—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gunpowder Wounds</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Gunpowder is not antiseptically clean. It is very dirty because
it contains so many of the deadly germs of lockjaw.</p>

<p>This germ has such a terrible effect upon the body that if not
destroyed in time, it causes the jaws to lock so tightly together that
they cannot be forced open. Gradually the patient starves to death
and finally dies in terrible convulsions of pain.</p>

<p>Toy pistols, firecrackers, blank cartridges, being loaded with
gunpowder are very dangerous playthings, and their use should be
discouraged. Any physician or nurse will tell you that the hospitals
have many deaths from tetanus (lockjaw) after the Fourth of July.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">What to Do for Powder Wounds</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>See a doctor.</p>

<p>Absolutely every wound of this character <i>must</i> be treated with

<p>“We never understood the dangers before, Miss Helpem.
Now, what will we have in that parade?” spoke up the
scout patrol leader.</p>

<p>“We need decide only about the float of the first-aiders,”
said Miss Helpem. “Your scout-master will
confer with you scouts as to the other part of the program.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” rejoined the patrol leader; “but, Miss
Helpem and Miss Shesa, have you thought out anything
for our first-aiders’ float?”</p>

<p>“To confess the truth,” laughed the nurse, “I think
Miss Shesa has no less than twenty ideas. Will you make
a few suggestions to the boys?” turning to her.</p>

<p>“Miss Helpem has more ideas in a minute than I have
in an hour,” began Shesa, “but she thought one of my
ideas good. It seemed to me that you boys might fix up
an improvised first-aid tent on your float, leaving it on the
Village Green after the parade. In case any real accident
occurred, Miss Helpem could have at hand everything she
needed—for somebody might be foolish enough to get hurt.
Then you could really do a little actual service by being
at her call.”</p>

<p>“It sounds wonderfully important,” said the patrol
leader.</p>

<p>“Only I do wish you boys had had some lessons in
bandaging,” commented Miss Helpem. “But we’ll all do
our best, anyway, and look forward with pleasure to those
lessons.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t we have a little chap all bandaged up,
with that toy cannon at his feet and a string of firecrackers
and a toy pistol in his hands, with a printed card on him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
saying, ‘I used these toys on the Fourth,’ and another little
perfectly well chap all dressed in bunting, carrying a flag
and holding a horn, bearing a sign, ‘I didn’t’?” asked the
patrol leader.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine idea,” said Ibee Brave, “but where do

<p>“We? Oh, we—” the patrol leader answered so lamely
that everybody laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can tell you, boys, a good way to be better prepared
for important work,” said Miss Helpem. “If you
are willing to take two more lessons before the Fourth, I
feel quite certain Miss Shesa will show you the simplest
first-aid bandages. She has been taking a full course in
first-aid at the hospital, you know. Then, on the float,
you may adjust bandages to each other.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully kind of Miss Shesa,” said the leader.
“Will all you fellows come?”</p>

<p>Everybody said yes, and the class was dismissed.</p>

<p>“Say, I wonder what the girls are going to do,” exclaimed
Tom Holden suddenly on the way home.</p>

<p>“That’s so! I wonder why we didn’t ask?” said another
boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to find out,” said Ibee Brave.</p>

Ibee, yawning sleepily, as he stretched out
in a steamer chair near the hammock in
which Soami rocked on the porch of the
Brave family’s cottage.</p>

<p>“Just—as—though—I’d—tell—you,” yawned Soami in
imitation of Ibee’s manner.</p>

<p>“Say, go on, tell me, won’t you?” said Ibee. “I’ll
tell you a little about ours if you do.”</p>

<p>“Yum, yum,” sang Soami. “I might possibly tell you
a little—you tell first.”</p>

<p>“Has Shesa anything to do with your plans?” asked Ibee.</p>

<p>“Oh, so she’s going to give you lessons in bandaging,
too!” exclaimed Soami, realizing the next instant that she
had given a secret away, but the “cat was out of the bag.”</p>

<p>Then Ibee began to laugh. “Caught you this time,
Sister,” he teased. “Shesa wouldn’t give me a hint.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I think you were awful!” said Soami. “I’ll

<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Triangular_Bandages"></a>Triangular Bandages</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Bandages cut in the form of triangles are the most useful first-aid
bandages, for they are very readily adjusted, and may be applied
to so many different uses; for instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To hold dressings (compresses) in place.</p>

<p>To support broken or fractured parts of the body (sling).</p></div>

<p>We will have on hand for our uses:</p>

<p>One large triangular bandage, made from a piece of unbleached
muslin one yard square.</p>

<p>Cut the muslin across diagonally, as shown in “A.”</p>

<p>Two smaller triangular bandages, made by cutting a large triangular
bandage across as in “B.”</p>

<p>Of course any piece of goods may be used for a bandage, even
handkerchiefs or torn clothing; but we are speaking about the best
kind of bandages to have ready for use.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—For triangular bandage for doll twenty-one inches high, cut a piece
of soft muslin or lawn sixteen inches square. Cut across diagonally for one large
triangular bandage. To make the small triangular bandage, cut across the
remaining triangular piece.</p></div>

<p>Triangular bandages are used—</p>


<ul class="booklist2"><li>1. Unfolded.</li>
<li>2. Folded.</li></ul>



<p>When the triangular bandage is repeatedly folded on itself it
becomes the “cravat” bandage.</p>

<p>The triangular bandage, either unfolded or folded, may be used
on any part of the body. The smaller triangles are used for the hands
and feet and the jaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the ready-made first-aid packets will be found a triangular
bandage, on which are printed sketches of the manner in which
the bandage is applied.</p></div>

<p>You may see how these bandages are used by looking
at the picture (page 83) of Rose Mary, Mary Frances’
big dolly, which she bandaged so skilfully that all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

</div>

<p>If you practice putting these kinds of bandages on your
dolls perhaps you will be able some day to help somebody
who gets hurt, and seem yourself like a fairy to the
person whose pain you helped.</p>

<p>The children became so enthusiastic in practising the
various methods of bandaging that it grew to be quite a
joke in their homes. Many times they waylaid the various
members of their families, whom they wouldn’t let go until
they were bandaged to look like heroes from the battlefield.</p>

<p>The boys tried in vain to find out what the girls’ class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had planned for their Fourth of July “float.” They
taxed their brains guessing, but no one was more surprised
than they when the girls appeared ready for the parade,
all dressed in nurses’ outfits, decorated with a red cross,
each carrying a big doll, bandaged, head, hand, arm, foot,
in first-aid triangular bandages. In the center of the group,
Mike, the Brave family’s pet bulldog, was comfortably
perched, swathed in bandages. Mike wore a large placard
which read:</p>

<p>“See what fire crackers and toy pistols may do to you!”</p>

<p>He seemed to enjoy this particular Fourth, however,
more than any other the Brave family could remember.</p>

<p>The boys did have three “real cases” for their first-aid
hospital tent.</p>

<p>A very foolish youth, notwithstanding the Mayor’s
warning, shot off blank cartridges from a revolver, frightening
a horse nearby, which broke its halter and ran away,
throwing the young man down so hard that he had to be
taken to the first-aid tent with a broken arm.</p>

<p>Ibee Brave and Tom Holden happened to be near,
and were very proud as they bore the sufferer to the improvised
hospital.</p>

<p>They hadn’t noticed in their excitement that a little
boy had been wounded with the powder from the shot, and
felt mortified when two members of the girls’ class followed
them into the tent with the little patient.</p>

<p>Miss Helpem sent for Doctor Quickenquack, who set
the big boy’s broken arm and treated the little fellow’s
powder wounds.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, young man,” said the doctor to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
big boy, as he set the arm, “that not all the punishment
came to yourself. If these powder wounds become serious
for that youngster, you will be blamed.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize, Doctor,” replied the young man.
“I’ll never need any further lesson—after all this, and
after I pay my fine.”</p>

<p>The other “case” was a lady who fainted when she
saw the accident, and was quickly revived in the tent.</p>

<p>“I really believe that this is the best Fourth of July
celebration our town has ever known, Doctor,” said the
Mayor, complimenting Doctor Surecure upon the success
of the day. “‘A sane Fourth’ as you said, will give more
pleasure, if people will co-operate, than all the din of firecrackers
and thunder of powder. I’m sure we owe you
and your able first-aid classes our vote of thanks.”</p>

<p>“Miss Helpem deserves all the credit for the first-aid
help,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Indeed no, thank you, Doctor,” laughed Mary Frances
Helpem, coming up at that moment. “To the boys and
girls of the classes belongs that praise.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Shesa, a Red Cross Nurse</span></small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“WHAT do you hear from your brother, Shesa?”
asked Miss Bossem of Shesa Brave a few
days later, as she was leaving the advanced
class in first-aid.</p>

<p>The young girl looked troubled. “We
haven’t heard a word for nearly five weeks,” she replied.
“I have been thinking seriously of going to the front as a
volunteer nurse, hoping I may be able to get news of Ima.”</p>

<p>“That seems like an excellent idea to me,” said the
head nurse. “You, being a member of the American Red
Cross Society, can manage very nicely, I think.”</p>

<p>So, within a week, Shesa Brave started for Mexico.</p>

<p>She was put on duty in an emergency hospital along the
frontier. As the soldiers were brought in she scanned each
face eagerly, but many a weary day passed before she had
any tidings of Ima.</p>

<p>To every inquiry she sent out, the report came back,
“Missing.”</p>

<p>A great fear came upon her that Ima had been killed.
She couldn’t bear the thought that her big handsome brave
brother had died without even a record of what had happened;
but she worked industriously, nursing other people’s
brothers and writing letters to the loved ones at home to
relieve their anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>While taking a walk one day in her hours off duty,
Shesa wandered farther away from the hospital than usual.
She was thinking of Ima. Before realizing it, she had lost
her direction and found herself in a lovely little valley.
The scenery along the border had been so uninteresting, with
low cactus plants growing out of the sand, and scrub bushes
stretching away in low irregular outline, that this spot
came as a delightful surprise.</p>

<p>Spying a little cabin on the side of the mountain above
the valley, she decided to inquire the way back, and, quickening
her steps, reached it in a short time.</p>

<p>A slovenly woman appeared at the door. Five small
children surrounded her, pulling at her skirts as they saw
the stranger. The youngest set up a howl of disapproval as
Shesa came nearer. In her arms the woman held a baby
and in one hand a tin pan of maize or corn. A few chickens
came scurrying around the corner of the house as the
woman tapped a wooden paddle on the edge of the pan.</p>

<p>The woman stopped and eyed Shesa suspiciously as she
came still nearer.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Shesa with a smile. “Do you
speak English?”</p>

<p>“Howdy,” grunted the woman. “Yes. Hush up,
will ye?” to the children, whose noises made conversation
difficult.</p>

<p>“United States?” she asked as she looked Shesa’s
uniform over.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” replied Shesa. “I’m a nurse.”</p>

<p>“Nuss?” said the woman. “Then ye’ll know what be
ailing him. Come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i-094.jpg" width="424" height="338" alt="brother in sick bed recognizes his nurse" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">“Sister!” He Exclaimed</span></div>
</div>

<p>Shesa hesitated a moment before entering the low
cabin which was scarcely more than a hut; but, being a
brave girl, she thought, “If I am needed, I mustn’t hesitate.
I’ll try to find out what’s wanted.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your trouble,” she said kindly to the
woman. “Is your husband ill?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” the woman shook her head, “he be all right.
It’s a U. S. man we found up yonder,” pointing up the
mountain road. “Been shot in arm. My man brought
him home, but his arm gets worse all time. You know
what to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I can help,” said Shesa, wishing with all her
heart she had brought her emergency kit with her. “Let
me see your patient.”</p>

<p>The woman led the way into the only bedroom in the
cabin. On a rude wooden bed lay a young man, dressed
in a much soiled khaki uniform. At the sound of Shesa’s
voice, he started up. “Sister!” he exclaimed. “Why,
this seems too good to be true! Oh, perhaps I’m dreaming.
My arm pains so I guess I’m just ‘seeing things’
from fever.”</p>

<p>For one moment Shesa lost her self-control. Tears
filled her eyes and she longed to throw her arms about
Ima’s neck and cry to her heart’s content. “But I must not,”
she chided herself. “I must do everything I can to help him.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a dream, Ima, dear,” she said as naturally as
if they were in their faraway home. “You are ill and certainly
do need me. Let me see your arm.”</p>

<p>The sight of his poor wounded arm made her feel sick,
for it evidently had been neglected from the first.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” Shesa asked, as she tore her
apron into bandages and directed the woman to boil some
water on the open fire which she had seen outside.</p>

<p>She saw that Ima wanted to talk, sick and weary as
he was.</p>

<p>“I was taking a stroll alone one evening,” he explained,
“not thinking of the least danger, for our camp lights
were scarcely out of sight. Suddenly I heard the report
of a gun, and felt an awful pain in my right arm. One of
the bandits had evidently spotted me from ambush. I’d
have been all right, but the fellow or an accomplice sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
upon me, and after a struggle knocked me senseless and
took my emergency kit and everything else useful away
from me. The settler who owns this cabin found me and
brought me up here on his shoulders. His wife did what
she could for my wound, but it became infected almost
immediately, and I was too weak from loss of blood to walk
back to camp, even with the man’s help. Besides, in some
way, I had a sprained ankle.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, you are going to be helped in every way
soon, so don’t talk any more,” said Shesa, taking off some
of the dirty rags which the woman had tied clumsily upon
Ima’s ankle. She bathed the ankle in hot water and bound
it firmly in a figure-of-eight bandage, which gave him the
first ease from pain since the accident.</p>

<p>She replaced the outside layers of the dirty bandages
on his wounded arm. “The wounds may bleed if I take the
dressings off,” she decided wisely, “and I have no remedies
here.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why the man didn’t go for help?” she
thought.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Ima whispered, “I would have sent
word to camp, but for some reason the settler seems afraid—of
the bandits, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Shesa, “you rest here, and we’ll soon have
help.”</p>

<p>“But, Shesa, it will be dangerous for you to go,” said
Ima. Then suddenly, “Why, how did you happen to come
here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear, I’ll explain all that later,” replied
Shesa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I want to hear now,” insisted Ima, his eyes
bright with fever. So to satisfy him, Shesa briefly related
the story of her little walk.</p>

<p>“Now,” she added “since the emergency hospital is so
near, you need not worry until I come back?”</p>

<p>He promised to try not to worry, and fell into a dozy
sleep within a few minutes.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SHESA hurried along by the path she thought
she had taken to reach the cabin, but after
walking ten minutes, found herself going
in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” she exclaimed, “when
I am in such a hurry!”</p>

<p>She looked about her. “It is nearing sunset,” she
whispered, looking at the sky. “Oh, I wish I knew the
way!”</p>

<p>Just at that moment a noise in the underbrush startled
her. Although very brave, she was dreadfully afraid of
snakes, even harmless ones, but she laughed when she saw
a tiny prairie dog scamper out of the bushes, stand on his
hind feet and look about him with blinking eyes.</p>

<p>“How foolish I am!” she thought, but shuddered again
as she heard someone stepping up behind her.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon,” said a gentlemanly voice—and turning,
you can imagine how relieved Shesa was to see a
United States soldier standing with his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried happily, “I’m so thankful to see you.
Will you help me find my way to the emergency hospital?”
Then she stopped and laughed. “I must apologize for

excitement when I explain all that has happened to me
this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier quickly led the way as she talked.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at the emergency hospital, and after
Shesa’s explanation, the doctors took her in a field ambulance
up to the cabin, the soldier showing the way.</p>

<p>Within two hours, Private Brave lay on a clean white
cot, with clean dressings on his arm and comforting broth
in his stomach.</p>

<p>“I feel a hundred per cent better already,” he said to
Shesa as she kissed him good-night. “In the morning I’ll
be well.”</p>

<p>But in the morning the doctors shook their heads. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
afraid that arm will have to be amputated,”
said the chief surgeon.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor!” exclaimed Shesa,
“can’t it be saved?”</p>

<p>“If it is saved,” said the doctor
gruffly, not liking to show how sorry
he was for the pretty nurse, “it will
be saved for a dead man. A neglected
infected wound, even small, may mean
gangrene. This is a large, badly neglected
infected wound!”</p>

<p>Shesa bit her lips and held back
the tears, saying, “Of course, if it’s to
save his life, Doctor—” Then she went
out to telegraph to her family.</p>

<p>The telegram read:</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THREE weeks later, a soldier with one arm
and his very attentive sister were looked
upon with much interest by the other passengers
on a steamer going to New York.</p>

<p>Ima stood the journey well, but when
they arrived at the station, Shesa decided to take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
direct to the Dolls’ Hospital to rest instead of home, where
he would be under a good deal of excitement.</p>

<p>So it was in the Dolls’ Hospital that the Brave family
came together again, rejoicing in the escape of their soldier.
Even Mike, the dog, was allowed to come, and no one
greeted him with more joy than did their family pet.</p>

<p>Private Brave didn’t mend as well as the doctors and
nurses had hoped. Within a week after his arrival at the
hospital, an abscess developed on his left forearm, which
caused everyone to worry, and another operation was all that
saved poor Private Brave from losing his only remaining arm.</p>

<p>The assistant nurse dressed and bandaged this abscess
with—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roller Bandages</span><br />

<small>(<i>See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Reference List</a></i>)</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot instruct">

<p>Roller bandages are usually made of long straight pieces of gauze.
This material “gives” to the form of the arm much better than muslin.
Never put a bandage on wet, for it shrinks and is too tight when dry.</p>

<p>You will be interested in seeing a picture on page 99 of how a
roller bandage is applied to an arm or leg.</p>

<p>This picture shows one of Mary Frances’ big dolls bandaged in
roller bandages.</p>

<p>The two-and-a-half-inch wide roller bandage four or six yards long
is the size most used for grown-up people, although narrower ones are
needed for fingers.</p>

<p>On the doll’s body inch-wide bandages were used, and the ends
were sewed in place. To prevent slipping, strips of adhesive plaster
were placed over the folds of the edges.</p></div>

<p>Under the assistant nurse’s kind care, Private Brave
soon grew better and was able to take an interest in the
other patients.</p>

he wouldn’t be so lonely.</p>

<p>There was great excitement among the boys in the ward,
none of whom were very ill, when a
real soldier came to visit them.</p>

<p>They coaxed him to tell them about
his adventures.</p>

<p>They liked best the story about
how he lost his arm, and this one
about the stolen baby:</p>

</div>

<p>“We were riding along one day,
when I thought I heard a baby’s cry.
None of the other boys seemed to hear
it, and as we were not riding in order, I
headed my horse toward the sound. I
had about concluded that I was
mistaken, when the horse stopped
short. The crying had ceased by this
time.</p>

<p>“I looked down, and there among
the sage-brush, at the horse’s feet, was
a little baby about a year old. How it came in such a place,
I have no idea. There was no house within forty miles, and
we hadn’t met a soul.</p>

<p>“I got off my horse and picked the little thing up and
rode with it to our captain. It appeared to be half starved
and surely could not have survived much longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“We carried it with us into camp, fed it and took care
of it as best we could.</p>

<p>“On making inquiries, we found the baby had been
stolen from some poor white settlers. Who did it or why,
no one ever found out.</p>

<p>“When the poor mother came into camp and we put
the baby into her arms she was the happiest woman I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that grand!” cried Bobby to Sammy, the little
lame boy in the next bed. Sammy was the plaster-of-Paris
doll Mary Frances had bought for a nickel at the
children’s fair.</p>

<p>All the patients were sorry—and the doctors and
nurses, too—when the time came for Private Brave to leave
the hospital.</p>

<p>He had been so bright and cheerful that they would
miss him greatly.</p>

<p>He felt sorry, too, in a way, for so many interesting
things had happened; for instance—but perhaps you would
rather hear the story of the mad dog as Private Brave
told it to his family.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">PRIVATE BRAVE was comfortably seated in
the home living room with his family gathered
around to hear what had happened while
he was in the hospital.</p>

<p>“It was about four o’clock in the afternoon,”
he began. “I had just finished telling the boys
about saving the baby, and all my other experiences which
you know, when suddenly we heard a woman crying as
she rushed past the ward door.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Doctor,’ she sobbed, ‘will he die—will my little
boy die? He didn’t know the dog would bite, poor child!
He says the dog isn’t mad, but everybody else says he is!’</p>

<p>“‘Come,’ said the doctor, ‘mad or not, we’ll fix this
young man up so he’ll be quite safe. I’m glad you brought
him to me immediately.’</p>

<p>“I was on my feet in an instant, and ran to the office
door, for I was very anxious to hear what would be done for
the little boy.</p>

<p>“‘This must be cauterized, Nurse,’ said the doctor.
‘Get nitrate of silver ready.’</p>

<p>“He dipped a wooden stick into the poison and turned
it around in the wound, the little boy screaming with
the pain.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Doctor,’ asked his mother, ‘must he be hurt so
much?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Safety must first be considered,’ replied the doctor.
‘We are probably destroying the dreadful germs of hydrophobia.
And, next, this little boy must be given Pasteur
treatment with the wonderful serum used to prevent hydrophobia,
for hydrophobia means the most terrible suffering
anybody could imagine. Of course, no one is quite certain
that the dog was mad; for many a time a dog which has
been nearly crazed with thirst, or been the victim of bad
boys’ pranks, has been thought mad.’</p>

<p>“‘But this doggy wasn’t mad,’ the boy cried out,
forgetting his pain. ‘A bad boy was twisting his tail and
the poor doggy thought I did it because I was near!’</p>

<p>“‘Are you certain, little fellow?’ asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir, and after he bit me, a big man beat him
with his cane, and the poor doggy ran yelping down the
street. Oh, how you made my arm ache, Doctor!’</p>

<p>“‘Poor boy!’ said the doctor, ‘I really had to hurt you.’</p>

<p>“‘What should I have done, Doctor, if we had been
miles from a physician?’ asked the mother.</p>

<p>“‘That’s a good question,’ replied Doctor Surecure.
‘I will tell you the simplest treatment for an untrained
person to use—</p>

<p>Whether there is <i>danger of hydrophobia</i> or not, if bite is on
limb, tie a cloth tightly around limb between wound and body, and
encourage bleeding by squeezing. Wash with soap and hot water.
Apply iodine. Loosen cloth in an hour.</p>

<p>If there is the <i>slightest</i> danger of <i>hydrophobia</i>, <i>get patient to a doctor!</i>
If impossible to get a doctor, apply nitrate of silver, or pure carbolic
acid with a soft stick. But it seems that there are few places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a doctor cannot be consulted within twenty-four hours,—who will
see that the patient is given Pasteur treatment to prevent hydrophobia

<p>“Well, I am certainly glad to learn that, my son,” said
Private Brave’s mother. “We had a terrible fright the
day the little boy was bitten, for somebody said that our
Mike did it.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Private Brave. “Did anybody
dare accuse this most faithful and wonderfully brave dog-member
of the Brave family?”</p>

<p>Mike had been lying at his young master’s feet; in
fact, he hadn’t left him since he came home—not even to
eat his dinner. On hearing his
name, Mike stood up, wagging his
tail so hard that you would have
thought it would drop off unless it was
nailed on.</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly upon the
family, his mouth open and his intelligent
brown eyes questioning what all
this talk meant.</p>

good old fellow!” exclaimed Ibee,
petting him.</p>

<p>“Bow! Bow!” barked Mike, and Ibee declared he
smiled.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Private Brave, “that was—” He didn’t
finish the sentence, for at that instant the next door neighbor
came running into the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Miss Shesa!” she exclaimed. “My baby’s
dying—she’s swallowed poison.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SHESA hastened away with the neighbor, for
she knew that any delay might cost the
baby’s life. She could hear the little girl’s
agonizing screams.</p>

<p>“Ibee, run for the doctor,” she called.</p>

<p>“We must work until the doctor comes,” she said to the
distracted mother. She was wise enough to realize that it
would be best to keep the mother busy.</p>

<p>“What kind of poison—do you know?” asked Shesa
anxiously, as they ran up the steps of the porch.</p>

<p>“Lye,” answered the mother briefly. “The maid was
scrubbing the kitchen steps, and left the can of lye on the
floor. Baby came along, saying ‘dink, dink,’ and before
Sally Ann could get into the door, baby had swallowed a
mouthful. It couldn’t have been very strong, for Sally Ann
had filled up the can with water.”</p>

<p>Shesa took the baby on her lap and looked into its poor
little burnt mouth.</p>

<p>“Bring a glass of water and some vinegar,” she ordered.
When they came, she diluted the vinegar with water giving
the baby a teaspoonful at a time.</p>

<p>“Bring the juice of a lemon,” she said. This she
diluted, giving it to the baby in the same way.</p>

<p>It must have stopped some of the suffering, for the little
one began to seem more comfortable.</p>

<p>“Now, the beaten white of an egg in water,” she said
at length. Of this she gave the baby a tablespoonful; then
a tablespoonful of olive
oil, holding its little
mouth shut to make it
swallow.</p>

<p>By the time the
doctor arrived, the
baby had fallen asleep
on Shesa’s lap.</p>

<p>“You have saved
this baby’s life, Miss
Brave,” said the doctor.
“If it hadn’t been
for prompt action, the
child might have died.”</p>

<p>“People are so
careless with poisons,”
he went on. “Poisons
should never be placed
within the reach of
little children. All bottles
should be labeled
plainly, and the stoppers should be tied about with a piece
of gauze—not very attractive, I admit, but one of the best
safeguards against making a mistake as to the ‘right bottle.’
Poisons should not be kept in the general medicine closet,
but in a place by themselves—unless we except iodine,
which has such a decided odor that it may be kept in a
more accessible place, ready for its many uses.”</p>

<p>After complimenting Shesa again on her treatment of
the baby, and leaving some medicines for both the baby
and the baby’s mother, the doctor went
away.</p>

<p>Shesa was met by her mother as she
started home.</p>

<p>“We are all so anxious, dear,” she
said, “to learn how the baby is.”</p>

<p>“The baby’s all right,” smiled Shesa.</p>

<p>“How thankful Ima will be!” exclaimed
her mother. “It brings tears to
my eyes to see how interested that dear
boy is in everybody, thinking so little
about his own misfortunes. Think of a
young man just at his age losing an
arm!”</p>

<p>“Father told me that last night when
he tried to express a little sympathy, Ima
said, ‘Well, Father, it is a loss; but
you know, I have one arm left!’” Shesa
replied.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that wonderful!” exclaimed
Mrs. Brave.</p>

<p>“It certainly is wonderful how bravely he takes his
troubles,” replied Shesa. “Father said he thought that it
really required more bravery to feel that way than to go
to the battlefield.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached home, and Shesa had to
tell everybody about the saving of the life of the poisoned
baby.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Brave family were not the only people
who admired Private Brave’s cheerful acceptance
of his fate and his determination to
make his left hand learn to do the work of
two hands.</p>

<p>One day when he was running the lawn mower over
the lawn in front of the house, Doctor Quickenquack
stopped in his dollsmobile.</p>

<p>“Hello, how’s the ‘General’?” he called. “Can’t you
jump in and take a ride? Hope you’re not too busy to
have a little holiday.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Doctor,” said Private Brave, “it’s certainly
kind of you to ask me. Will you wait until I put this
mower away and get my coat?”</p>

<p>He had to lock the door, for none of the family were
home, but he hopped into the car in a minute’s time. The
doctor started the engine and away they rode toward
Painted River and Looking Glass Lake. It was a beautiful
morning and Private Brave enjoyed the ride very much.</p>

<p>“If you will just let me out here, I’ll walk home from
this corner,” said he as they came to River Avenue.</p>

<p>“Not much, sir; you’re kidnapped,” laughed the
doctor as he drove on toward the hospital.</p>

<p>“First, your lunch; then a visit to the boys’ ward,”
said the doctor. “That’s your program, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Private Brave was delighted with the idea, and how he
enjoyed his lunch after the ride!</p>

<p>When he went with the doctor to the boys’ ward, you
can’t imagine how surprised he was to see all his own
family. Not only they were there, but also the boys’
class and the girls’ class in first-aid.</p>

<p>Besides these, wore Miss Bossem and Miss Helpem and
Doctor Surecure and even the ambulance driver, Billy.</p>

<p>Doctor Quickenquack led Private Brave under an
American flag which was draped in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>“Dear Private Brave,” said Doctor Surecure, clearing
his throat, “it is my pleasure to present to you a gift from
some of your many admiring friends.”</p>

<p>Private Brave blushed at the praise, and smiled as Miss
Helpem carried forward a box which she placed on the
little table beside him.</p>

<p>He opened the lid and lifted out a beautiful little hand-embroidered
silk flag.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’d better help you open the box the rest
of the way,” suggested Doctor Surecure. “Let us step
into the next room.”</p>

<p>When the doctors and Private Brave came back—what
do you think? Private Brave was waving the beautiful
little silk flag in the hand of a new wooden arm, so
skilfully made that it had almost human action.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted the boys and girls in delight.
“Hurrah! Hurrah for Private Brave! Hurrah for Our
Hero!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” they shouted together at the top
of their lungs.</p>

<h2>A FEW GENERAL REMARKS</h2>


<p>In the story part of this little book, the author has endeavored
to show that success in first-aid treatment of any open wound lies in
protecting the wound from infection.</p>

<p>From long years of experience, physicians have found that:</p>

<p>1. Every open wound should be touched with an antiseptic to
kill germs which may have entered; and that the best general antiseptic
known is <i>iodine</i>.</p>

<p>2. No wound should be closed entirely from the air; therefore,
do not use adhesive plaster or collodion to cover a cut or wound, but
cover it with sterile gauze after using iodine. The gauze may be held
in place at each side by adhesive plaster or by a bandage.</p>

<p><i>When sending for the doctor, be sure to let him know what is the
matter: for instance, poison case, or drowning, or choking—so that he
may bring the articles necessary to treat the case.</i></p>

<p>N. B.—In case of wounds from powder, or punctured wounds, as
from rusty nail, see a doctor who will treat patient with anti-tetanic
serum.</p>

<p>Read the chapters concerning bandages: <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapters XIII</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">XVI</a>.</p>

<p>Bandages are used: 1. To hold dressings in place. 2. To support the parts. 3. To hold splints in place.</p>

<p>Never use wet bandages—they shrink in drying.</p>

<p>Never put a tight bandage over a wet compress; use a loose
triangular bandage. The <i>exclusion of air</i> might also cause blisters.</p>

<p>An emetic is a medicine which causes vomiting.</p>

<p>To sterilize a needle or knife blade, dip into alcohol or pass through
an alcohol or gas flame; or hold in boiling waiter several minutes.</p>

<p>To make a saturated solution dissolve in water as much of the
powder mentioned as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Remember that heat in the form of hot drinks and hot
applications is the best kind of stimulant.</p>

<h2>A READY REFERENCE LIST</h2>

<div class="instruct">
<p>Reference to poisonous remedies has been carefully avoided as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Where dosage is not mentioned in the following, refer to List of
Remedies for the <a href="#Page_136">Home Medicine Closet, page 136</a>.</p>


<div class="sub">Biliousness.</div>

<p>Give citrate of magnesia, or Epsom or Rochelle salt, or <a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>castor
oil. Cracked ice slowly melted in the mouth generally relieves sick
stomach.</p>

<p>Hot, clear coffee given after any of the above medicines counteracts
greatly the nauseating effect.</p>


<div class="sub">Bites of Dogs, Cats, Snakes.</div>

<p>If on a limb, tie a cloth tightly around limb, between wound and
body. Loosen slightly in an hour. Encourage bleeding by squeezing,
to get poison out, or suck and spit out blood from the wound, being
careful to see there are no cuts or wounds in the mouth or lips, through
which the poison may enter. <i>Apply iodine.</i></p>

<p>If <i>hydrophobia</i> (rabies) is suspected, <i>send for doctor at once</i>, who
will see that correct treatment is given. This treatment is concerned
with the injection of a serum into the blood. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>.</p>


<div class="sub">Bites of Insects, Spiders, etc.</div>

<p>Treat as for <i>stings</i>.</p>

<p>These are seldom dangerous to life.</p>


<div class="sub">“Black Eye.”</div>

<p>For “black eye,” use either cold or hot water compresses immediately.
Massage gently for discoloration.</p>


<div class="sub">Bleeding of Gums.</div>

<p>Rinse mouth with alum water—1 teaspoon powdered alum in a
glass of ice water; or 1 tsp. tincture of myrrh in 1 tbsp. water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sub">Blood Blisters.</div>

<p>Do not open. Apply hot water.</p>


<div class="sub">Broken Bones or Fractures.</div>

<p>There are two kinds of fractures:</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1. Simple, where the bone only is broken.</p>

<p>2. Compound, where the skin is broken through at point of
fracture.</p></div>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Send for doctor at once. Much harm is done by unskilled handling.
Do not move patient unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If a compound fracture, apply iodine. Bandage a sterile gauze
compress loosely over wound, tie a cloth tightly around limb, between
wound and body. See “<a href="#Hemorrhage">Hemorrhage”</a> in this list.</p>

<p>Using <i>extreme gentleness</i>, place limb in comfortable position on a
pillow or pad, and tie fast with strips of muslin or bandages.</p>

<p>If impossible to get doctor for a long time, and patient must be
moved, use extreme carefulness, and tie limb to padded splints with
bandages.</p>

<p>Rulers, umbrellas, sticks, rolled newspapers, may be used for
splints. If an arm, after applying splints, place in sling made with
triangular bandage, or pin coat sleeve to front of shirt.</p>

<p>Treat for “<a href="#Shock">Shock</a>.”</p>


<div class="sub">Bruises or Contusions.</div>

<p>“Black and blue” spots from blow or fall or pinching, causing
blood vessels to rupture under skin.</p>

<p>Apply at first:</p>


<ul class="booklist2"><li>Ice, or ice water; or</li>
<li>Alcohol and water, half and half; or</li>
<li>Witch hazel, or arnica; or</li>
<li>Vinegar diluted with water.</li></ul>



<p>Afterward use hot applications. Gentle rubbing or massaging helps
dispel the discoloration. If surface is scraped, as from fall in sand, see
“<a href="#Wounds">Wounds</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">Burns and Scalds.</div>

<p>There are three different degrees of burns:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Mere reddening of the skin (slight burns).</p>

<p>2. Formation of blisters (deeper burns).</p>

<p>3. Charring and destruction of the skin and tissues.</p></div>

<p>1. For slight burns (first degree), apply any of the following:</p>

<p>Bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) mixed in water to the thickness
of milk, olive oil, cream, vaseline, lard, butter, white of egg, or flour
and water paste, or starch and water.</p>

<p>Spread gauze compress<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> with the material used, and bandage
loosely in place.</p>

<p>2. In deeper burns (second degree), be careful in removing clothing—cut
it off, if necessary, to prevent tearing the skin.</p>

<p>Bandage on loosely compresses wet in one of the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Normal Salt Solution (1 level tsp. salt in 1 pint boiled water);</p>

<p class="unindent">or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Carron Oil (½ lime water, ½ linseed oil);</p>

<p class="unindent">or</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Saturated Solution Bicarbonate of Soda. (Dissolve as much
baking soda as possible in a cup of boiled water;)</p>

<p class="unindent">or</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Picric Acid Gauze Compress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Follow any of these treatments with Boric Acid Ointment.
(See <a href="#List_of_Medicines">List of Medicines</a>, No. 22).</p></div>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><b>Blisters.</b> Later, puncture blisters near base with a sharp instrument
which has been sterilized by dipping in alcohol. Mop
up the watery discharge with a little aseptic absorbent
cotton, throwing it away. Never open blisters far enough
to loosen skin. Dress with gauze compresses, dusted with
boric acid. Use several small compresses if burned surface
is large.</p></div>

<p>3. In very severe burns (third degree) little can be done. <i>Send
for the doctor.</i> Do not remove clothing. Make patient as comfortable
as possible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>For burns about the eye, anoint with olive oil and wash out with
boric acid solution in eye dropper or eye cup. (See <a href="#List_of_Medicines">List of Medicines</a>,
No. 3.) Use compresses wrung out of ice water. See doctor.</p>


<div class="sub">Car Sickness.</div>

<p>Fresh air. Lying-down position.</p>

<p>Do not look out of window at moving objects. Keep eyes closed.</p>


<div class="sub">Chilblains.</div>

<p>Chilblains are the result of too rapid warming of cold parts,
generally feet or fingers. Sometimes for years after being frost-bitten,
exposure to severe cold will produce itching and burning, and perhaps
swelling and ulcers.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Rub with turpentine or alcohol. The rubbing in itself is excellent.
See doctor.</p>


<div class="sub">Chills.</div>

<p>Use heat. Apply hot-water bags under arms, on thighs and at
feet. Give hot foot bath, in which is 1 tbsp. mustard. Rub limbs
toward body, to restore circulation. Give hot coffee or tea, or hot
lemonade. Wrap in blankets and put to bed. Chills indicate
oncoming illness—see doctor! See <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.</p>


<div class="sub">Choking.</div>

<p>Slap on back. Pass finger down throat. This usually causes
vomiting. If a child, hold him up by the feet, head downward, and
slap on the back. Send for doctor, if severe.</p>


<div class="sub">Coal Gas, Suffocation from.</div>

<p><i>Send for doctor.</i></p>

<p>Get patient into fresh air—loosen clothing. Keep patient warm
with hot-water bags. Rub limbs toward body. Dash cold water in
face. Doctor will probably use artificial respiration.</p>


<div class="sub">Colds.</div>

<p>At the <i>first sign</i> of “taking a cold”—use some simple remedy,
such as inhaling camphor from time to time for several hours. Dampen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the center of a handkerchief in water, and drop on it some spirit of
camphor. <i>Eat a sliced onion.</i><a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p>Take two drops of spirit of camphor on a tsp. sugar.</p>

<p>Or, drop five drops camphor in ½ tumbler of water. Take a tsp.
every half hour.</p>

<p>Ginger tea is a much valued old-fashioned remedy. Pour boiling
water over a tbsp. bruised ginger root. Let stand two hours. The
dose is 1 tbsp. every hour or two.</p>

<p>If the “cold” continues, take a laxative, such as castor oil or
rhubarb, and follow the dose with a hot foot bath at night and hot
lemonade after getting into bed, to induce perspiration. Keep well
covered.</p>

<p>If a cough comes with the cold, lemon juice and sugar syrup make
a pleasant cough remedy; or molasses-and-vinegar syrup is liked by
children. Mix in the proportion of 1 tbsp. vinegar to 2 tbsp. molasses.</p>

<p><i>Flaxseed tea</i> will sometimes relieve a “tickling” cough. Pour
2 cups of boiling water over 1 tbsp. whole flaxseeds. Stir; let simmer
gently one-half hour. Add juice of half a lemon, and sugar if desired.
Take a tbsp. as often as wished.</p>

<p>If the chest is sore, rub it with camphorated oil, or ammonia liniment,
which is made by shaking together in a bottle 4 tbsp. olive (sweet)
oil and 1 tbsp. household ammonia. This hardens upon standing a
few days—so it is best made as needed.</p>

<p>All these are simple home remedies, but if a cold is severe, see a
doctor. A neglected cold is dangerous.</p>


<div class="sub">Colic.</div>

<p>Colic pains in abdomen are generally caused by indigestible food,
overeating, constipation, etc.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Give peppermint in hot water; hot-water enema. Keep abdomen
warmly wrapped in flannel; use hot-water bottles, or turpentine stupe.</p>

<p>If a child—massage abdomen with warm olive oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">Convulsions of Children.</div>

<p>Caused by indigestion, constipation or oncoming illness. Child
becomes stiff, pulse is weak and rapid. Breathing is feeble, face is
pale at <i>first</i>, afterward livid.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Send for doctor. Place child in warm bath, with ice bag (or ice-water
cloths) on head.</p>


<div class="sub">Corns.</div>

<p>For soft corn, apply vaseline.</p>

<p>For hard corn, apply iodine and remove pressure by using corn
plaster.</p>

<p>For a very sore corn, use a bread poultice at night. (See <a href="#PLASTERS_POULTICES_AND_STUPES">“Plasters
and Poultices</a>” at end of this list, <a href="#Page_134">page 134</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub"><a id="Croup"></a>Croup.</div>

<p>Croup is generally more alarming than dangerous.</p>

<p>Give 1 teaspoon syrup of ipecac to make child vomit.</p>

<p>Apply cloths wrung out of hot water on neck and chest.</p>

<p>A boiling tea kettle, in which there are 2 tbsp. compound tincture
of benzoin, will afford relief. Direct the steam toward the child so
that some of it may be inhaled.</p>

<p>Keep the child in the same warm room forty-eight hours, maintaining
the atmosphere at an even temperature.</p>

<p>The day after the attack, give the child castor oil or simple syrup
of rhubarb.</p>

<p>If croup does not clear up in twenty-four hours, see the <i>doctor</i> for
membranous croup or diphtheria.</p>

</div>

<div class="sub"><a id="Cuts"></a>Cuts (Slight).</div>

<p>Touch with—</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><i>Tincture of iodine, or
if iodine is not at
hand</i>,</p>

<p>Alcohol, or</p>

<p>Vinegar and water—equal parts.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>If edges are spread far apart, strap together with narrow
<i>strips</i> of adhesive plaster <i>across</i> wound. Wrap with sterile gauze.</p>

<p>If cut is larger, after applying iodine, fasten on a gauze compress—cut
½ inch larger than wound—with a bandage, or with <i>strips</i> of
adhesive plaster.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i>—Never cover a wound or cut airtight. (See also <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter
VII</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Diarrhea.</div>

<p>Usually caused by indigestion, impure water, etc. Home remedies
are raw flour and water paste; a raw egg in a cup of hot tea; spiced
syrup of rhubarb.</p>

<p>Give a dose of castor oil to clear the digestive tract of the irritating
material. If there is much pain, keep abdomen warm with
flannel and hot-water bag. If a small child, restrict diet to barley water
and white of egg in water.</p>

<p>Give adults milk and other liquid foods. If persistent, see
doctor.</p>


<div class="sub">Earache.</div>

<p>Caused sometimes by bad teeth, but generally by cold or hardened
ear wax.</p>

<p>Hold ear over cloth wrung out of hot water, on which are several
drops of alcohol. Syringe ear with warm bicarbonate of soda water—1
tsp. to a cup; or peroxide of hydrogen water—1 tbsp. to a cup of
water.</p>

<p>One drop laudanum, or one drop arnica to three drops very warm
olive oil, dropped into ear with a medicine dropper, often relieves
pain; or cotton may be saturated with the warm olive oil and placed
in the ear and covered with dry cotton. To prevent hardening of wax:
keep ear anointed with ordinary red vaseline (unbleached vaseline).
For watery discharge of ear, dust with dry boric acid.</p>


<div class="sub">Fainting.</div>

<p>Caused by too small a quantity of blood to the brain.</p>

<p>To prevent: Fresh air; drink of cold water; ½ tsp. aromatic spirit
of ammonia in water; bending head over between knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>If the person has fainted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Keep crowd back; place in lying-down position.</p>

<p>Dash face with cold water.</p>

<p>Let patient inhale smelling salts or household ammonia.</p>

<p>Rub limbs toward body.</p></div>

<p>Remember: An unconscious person cannot swallow. Medicine may
enter windpipe and cause strangulation. After patient becomes conscious,
give stimulants; such as aromatic spirit of ammonia or hot coffee.</p>


<div class="sub">Fever Blisters (Cold Sores).</div>

<p>Apply boric acid ointment,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> or touch frequently with spirit of
nitre or spirit of camphor.</p>


<div class="sub">Fits.</div>

<p>There are two kinds:</p>

<p>1. <i>Hysterical</i>—sobbing, crying and laughing without cause, jerky
movement of the limbs.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Let patient quietly alone.</p>

<p>2. <i>Epileptic</i>—convulsive movements and unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Treatment:</i></p>

<p>Keep patient from biting tongue by putting a piece of wood or
folded cloth between teeth. Lay on side; loosen clothing; turn face
to side so that secretions may not strangle.</p>

<p>After the fit, let patient sleep.</p>

<p>Do <i>not</i> give stimulants.</p>


<div class="sub">Foreign Body in Ear.</div>

<p>If an insect, drown out with warm olive oil, or pour a little pure
alcohol into ear.</p>

<p>Do not probe ear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="sub">Foreign Body in Eye.</div>

<p>Wink. Do not rub.</p>

<p>Lift upper lid down over lower, blowing opposite nostril.</p>

<p>If these means fail, turn lid back over a toothpick, removing
foreign body gently with the pointed corner of a handkerchief. For
bits of plaster, use dilute vinegar in eye cup. For acids, use very
dilute bicarbonate of soda solution. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Frost Bites.</div>

<p>Parts frozen turn whitish or waxy looking.</p>

<p>Do not bring patient into a warm room.</p>

<p>Use cold applications. Keep in cold room. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>.)</p>

<p>Rub with snow or ice-water cloths, <i>very gradually</i> applying heat.</p>


<div class="sub">“Gum Boils” or “Canker Sores.”</div>

<p>So-called “gum boils” or “canker sores” are little ulcer-like sores
which at times appear in children’s mouths, caused by disarrangement
of the stomach. Local applications, such as borax or powdered alum,
shrink the sores and give a little relief; but the child should be given a
dose of calcined magnesia at night or citrate of magnesia in the morning.
(Never give a small dose of citrate of magnesia; a child of twelve
years should take a tumblerful.)</p>


<div class="sub">Heat Exhaustion. (Collapse Due to Excessive Heat.) Dangerous!</div>

<p>In heat exhaustion, the symptoms and treatment are similar to
<i>shock:</i> pale face; weak, feeble heart beats; great weakness, but not
unconsciousness; shallow breathing; cold, clammy perspiration on
face.</p>

<p><i>Treatment:</i> Send for doctor. Remove to cool place.</p>

<p>Do <i>not</i> use cold applications. Give stimulants—hot coffee, tea,
aromatic spirit of ammonia, etc. Cover with blankets and use hot-water
bottles.</p>


<div class="sub"><a id="Hemorrhage"></a>Hemorrhage (Severe Bleeding).</div>

<p>Send for doctor. While waiting, try to staunch flow of blood.</p>

<p>If wound is in a limb:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>If blood is <i>red</i>, and comes in <i>spurts</i> (<i>arterial</i>)—</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Elevate wounded part, tie cloth tightly around limb between
<i>wound</i> and <i>body</i>,
or use a tourniquet,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
loosening
it in one hour.
If not loosened,
there is danger
of gangrene.</p>

<p>If blood is <i>dark</i>, and
comes in slow
flow (venous)—</p>

<p>Tie a cloth around between <i>end</i> of limb and wound. Or use a
tourniquet, loosening it in one hour.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Using a Tourniquet</span></div>
</div>

<p>In either case, bandage a clean gauze compress against wound.
If unable to use these methods because of too rapid bleeding, press
fingers into wound, but have another person tie as described. Do not
use finger pressure if possible to avoid, for the wound should be kept
clean.</p>

<p>Any of the following tend to stop bleeding:</p>


<ul class="booklist"><li>Ice or ice water.</li>
<li><i>Very hot</i> water.</li>
<li>Vinegar, 1 tbsp. to 4 tbsp. water.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 tsp. to 4 tbsp. water.</li></ul>



<p>Wet a compress (several thicknesses of gauze) in any of these and
bandage on wound.</p>

<p>For hemorrhage of lungs, place ice-bag on chest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">do NOT give whiskey or brandy!</span></p>

<p>For slight wounds, see “<i><a href="#Cuts">Cuts</a></i>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sub">Hiccough.</div>

<p>Generally caused by indigestion.</p>

<p>Nine to fifteen swallows of water without taking a breath, or one
or two soda-mint tablets, will generally give relief. If persistent, cause
vomiting by tickling throat with fingers, or by swallowing a cup of
warm water in which ½ tsp. mustard is dissolved. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Hives (Nettle Rash).</div>

<p>For itching, rub into them common table salt, or bathe with
equal parts vinegar and water.</p>

<p>Hives indicate stomach trouble. Give citrate of magnesia.</p>

<p>If hives persist, give ½ tsp. table salt in water or ¼ tsp. cream of
tartar in ¼ glass of water three times a day for three days.</p>

<p>If hives still persist, consult doctor. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Indigestion.</div>

<p>Hot water. Soda mints. Aromatic spirit of ammonia. Bicarbonate
of soda (baking soda). Hot applications to the stomach.</p>


<div class="sub">Itching.</div>

<p>For itching which affects the whole body, give a bath; apply
sulphur ointment.</p>

<p>Sulphur ointment is made by rubbing 2 tbsp. flowers of sulphur
into a dessertspoonful of lard.</p>


<div class="sub">Lice in Hair (Pediculosis).</div>

<p>Wash hair with kerosene, leaving it on over night; or use tincture
of <i>larkspur</i>[O] in the same way.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best remedy is <i>fishberries</i>.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>Five cents worth of the berries may be boiled in 1 pint water
for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Wash hair next day after using any of these remedies.</p>


<div class="sub">Nails (Ingrowing).</div>

<p>Scrape surface—a piece of glass is good for this purpose. Cut in
V-shape. Pack absorbent cotton under affected side. Paint with iodine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Nausea (Sick Stomach).</p>

<p>Give small bits of cracked ice. Soda mint. Lime water.</p>

<p>To crack ice: wrap a piece in a cloth, and hammer.</p>


<div class="sub">Nosebleed.</div>

<p>Head in upright position. Raise arm on bleeding side. Loosen
collar. Apply ice in a cloth to bridge of nose and back of neck. A
roll of paper under upper lip. Snuff cold tea up nose, or salt water,
1 tsp. to cup water, or the same of powdered alum.</p>

<p>If bleeding continues, tie a small wad of cotton with thread; dip
it into peroxide of hydrogen, and plug nostril by pushing the cotton
gently with a pencil. The thread is used to withdraw cotton.</p>

<p>If these means fail, send for doctor.</p>


<div class="sub">Perspiration.</div>

<p>For deodorizing—use a paste of borax and water.</p>


<div class="sub">Poison Ivy Rash.</div>

<p>The poison ivy plant has <i>three</i> leaves in clusters.</p>

<p>Do not scratch.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> Mop on rash a saturated solution of Epsom salt
(as much as can be dissolved in a cup of water); or, wash with saturated
solution boric acid. Allow it to dry in the air.</p>

<p>Lime water may be used in place of boric acid.</p>

<p>Wash the affected surface every day, dry and repeat treatment.</p>

<p>Sweet fern tea is very good. Steep the sweet fern in boiling water
an hour, and apply to rash.</p>


<div class="sub">Poisoning—Treatment and Antidotes.</div>

<p>Send for doctor, but work immediately.</p>

<p>If you do not know what caused the poisoning, make patient vomit
as soon as possible by giving 1 tsp. mustard in a cup of warm water, or
1 tsp. salt in a cup of warm water, or 2 tsp. ipecac. Repeat if necessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>After vomiting, give white of egg stirred in water; milk; or
boiled starch. Give hot coffee as stimulant.</p>

<p>There are three divisions of poisons:</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Those that affect the nervous system; as opium, aconite,
alcohol.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Those that irritate; as arsenic, tainted food.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Those that corrode (burn); as carbolic acid, oxalic acid,
bichloride of mercury (which is corrosive sublimate), lye,
caustic alkalies.</p></div>

<p>In any case of poisoning, remember that the first-aid treatment
is to—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Remove the poisonous material, or</p>

<p>2. Neutralize its further action.</p>

<p>3. Remedy the ill effects already produced.</p></div>

<p>1. To remove the poison, give emetic (to produce vomiting); as
mustard and water or ipecac or salt and water.</p>

<p>An emetic is <i>not usually used, however, in corrosive</i> poisoning (see (<i>c</i>)
above) except in the case of bichloride of mercury, for which see
special direction below.</p>

<p>2. To neutralize the further effect of poison, give something to
destroy its action; for instance, if lye is swallowed, give dilute acid,
as vinegar and water.</p>

<p>3. To remedy the ill effects, give stimulants; as strong coffee.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Antidotes</span></h3>

<p><i>For Carbolic Acid.</i>—In case of poisoning from <i>carbolic acid</i>, give
alcohol and <i>water</i>; or, if alcohol is not at hand, 1 tbsp. Epsom salt in
a glass of water, or beaten whites of eggs in milk. Use hot-water bottle.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Poisoning from Any Other Acids than Carbolic</i> (<i>Corrosives</i>).—Give
alkalies—baking soda, 1 tsp. in a cup water. Lime
water, magnesia, whitewash diluted with water; even a tbsp. of strong
soapsuds. Follow with beaten white of egg and milk, olive oil, coffee.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Poisoning from Alkalies</i> (<i>Lye</i>, <i>Household Ammonia</i>,
<i>etc.</i>). (<i>Corrosives.</i>)—Do not cause vomiting. 1 tbsp. vinegar in a cup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of water; lemon juice and water, half and half; orange juice; follow
with whites of egg in milk, olive oil; flour and water; hot coffee.</p>

<p><i>For Bichloride of Mercury</i> (<i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>).—Give beaten
whites of eggs in water; emetic—warm mustard water (1 tsp. to
cup); hot coffee. Keep patient warm.</p>

<p><i>For Iodine.</i>—Give boiled starch, or starch and water, or flour and
water. Give hot coffee. Keep patient warm.</p>

<p><i>For Arsenic</i> (<i>Irritant.</i> <i>See (b)</i>.).—Give an emetic; tincture of
iron, white of eggs, coffee.</p>

<p><i>For Laudanum</i> (<i>Affects Nerves.</i> <i>See (a)</i>.).—Keep patient awake
by walking. Give strong black coffee.</p>


<div class="sub"><a id="Powder_Wounds"></a>Powder Wounds.</div>

<p>Dangerous because powder carries germs of “lockjaw.”</p>

<p>Wash the skin. Paint with iodine.</p>

<p>Apply vaseline. This loosens any bits of powder, which may be
washed off the next day.</p>

<p><i>Absolutely every wound of this character must be treated by a doctor,
who will inject anti-tetanic serum.</i> (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Prickly Heat.</div>

<p>Rash, especially on young children, caused by heat. Wash with
warm water and soap. Apply alcohol (one part to three of water).
Dust with talcum powder. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">Ptomaine Poisoning.</div>

<p>Symptoms: Severe nausea, purging diarrhea. See doctor.</p>

<p><i>Treatment:</i> Vomiting is necessary. Give cup warm water in
which 1 tsp. mustard is dissolved, or give 2 tsp. ipecac. Give castor oil.</p>

<p>Apply external heat—hot-water bags.</p>

<p>Give 1 tsp. paregoric, if you have it.</p>


<div class="sub">Sea-Sickness.</div>

<p>Cracked ice. The best preventive is to see the doctor a week
before going on ocean trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">Shock.</div>

<p>The word “shock” refers to the condition of nervous depression
which follows any accident, or sometimes the sight of one’s own wound.
The breathing is feeble; the face pale. Send for doctor. Place patient
in lying-down position. Use hot-water bottles. Give hot coffee; aromatic
spirit of ammonia. Gently massage or rub limbs toward body.</p>

<p>Keep body covered and <i>warm</i>. (Sec Chapter III.)</p>


<div class="sub">Sore Throat.</div>

<p>At night wrap a cloth wet in alcohol around outside of throat.
Gargle with salt and water (1 tsp. to a glass), or borax and water in
same proportion, or hot tea, or with the following—</p>

<p>Gargle:</p>

<ul class="booklist2">
<li>2 tbsp. vinegar,</li>
<li>1 tbsp. salt,</li>
<li>Water to fill a tumbler.</li>
</ul>

<p>If persistent, see doctor.</p>


<div class="sub">Splinters.</div>

<p>Open wound with sterile needle. Pull splinter out from the direction
it entered. Apply iodine or turpentine.</p>

<p>If under nail, cut nail in V-shape at point where splinter entered,
before extracting splinter. Use tweezers. Paint the place with iodine.</p>

<p>A pair of extracting tweezers cost little, and should be in every
household.</p>

<p>To make needle or tweezers sterile, dip in alcohol or pass through
a flame.</p>


<div class="sub">Sprain.</div>

<p>If at all severe, send for doctor.</p>

<p>Elevate limb. Apply cloth wrung from ice water, or an ice bag, for
several hours, then apply heat. Bandage to keep limb at rest.</p>


<div class="sub">Stiff Neck.</div>

<p>Rub with sassafras oil or with capsicum vaseline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">Stings.</div>

<p>Extract sting if it remains imbedded in flesh. Apply household
ammonia, diluted with a little water, or solution of bicarbonate of soda
(1 tsp. soda to 1 cup water).</p>

<p>Mud, wet salt, slice of onion, arnica, witch hazel, camphor are
soothing. If there is much swelling, apply cracked ice. Apply spirit
of camphor or alcohol to mosquito bites.</p>


<div class="sub">Strain of Muscles.</div>

<p>Apply ice-water cloths or an ice bag. If the cold fails to give
relief in an hour, apply heat. Bathe with arnica, alcohol and water,
and rest the parts.</p>


<div class="sub">Sunburn.</div>

<p>To prevent: Anoint exposed parts with cold cream, vaseline, or
use toilet powder before going out.</p>

<p><i>Treatment:</i> Never wash sunburn. Never open blisters.</p>

<p>Apply—</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1 part lime water, 3 parts olive oil, shaken together in a
bottle.</p></div>


<div class="sub">Sunstroke (Collapse Due to Exposure to Rays of Sun).</div>

<p>Distinguish between sunstroke and heat exhaustion.</p>

<p>In sunstroke the symptoms are: red face; rapid heart beats;
headache; vomiting; fever; noisy breathing and sighing; stupor; no
perspiration; unconsciousness.</p>

<p><i>Treatment:</i> Send for doctor. Remove to cool place. Loosen
clothing. Apply ice in a cloth, or cloths wrung out of ice water to entire
body.</p>

<p>Give <span class="smcap">NO STIMULANTS—NO WHISKEY OR BRANDY</span>.</p>


<div class="sub">Toothache.</div>

<p>See dentist.</p>

<p>Hot applications. Iodine painted on gums. Oil of cloves on cotton
in tooth. (Be careful in using this.) (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">Warts.</div>

<p>Apply a “corn cure” containing “cannabis indica.” Nitric acid
may be applied, but it is so dangerous a poison that it is unsafe for
children to handle.</p>


<div class="sub"><a id="Wounds"></a>Wounds.</div>

<p>See “<i><a href="#Hemorrhage">Hemorrhage</a></i>” for deep, bleeding wounds.</p>

<p>If surface is scraped, as from a fall in sand, wash wound with hot
water (which has been boiled) and pure soap, such as Castile, and paint
with iodine. Fasten a sterile gauze compress in place over scraped
surface with a bandage or adhesive plaster.</p>

<h2><a id="PLASTERS_POULTICES_AND_STUPES"></a>PLASTERS, POULTICES AND STUPES</h2>


<p>Moist heat, in the form of plasters, poultices, and stupes, is more
penetrating than dry heat, and is often employed in cases of severe
inflammation.</p>

<p>Mustard plasters are in such common use that it seems unnecessary
to mention their value as counter-irritants.</p>

<p><i>To Make a Mustard Plaster.</i>—For an adult, mix together in the
proportion of 1 tbsp. mustard and 3 or 4 tbsp. flour, and rub into
a smooth paste with <i>warm</i> water—not <i>hot</i> or <i>cold</i> water.</p>

<p>For a child, use from 4 to 6 tbsp. flour to ½ tbsp. mustard.</p>

<p>Spread the paste on muslin, turning each edge over about an inch.
Cover with gauze or a piece of thin muslin.</p>

<p>To prevent blistering, it is well to add beaten white of egg in
making the plaster, and to anoint the skin with vaseline or olive oil
before applying the plaster.</p>

<p>After removing plaster (in about fifteen minutes), cover skin with
thin muslin.</p>

<p>If much inflamed, apply olive oil or vaseline.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Flaxseed is the favorite material for making a poultice, because
the oil in the seed retains heat longer than most other materials.</p>

<p><i>To Make a Flaxseed Poultice.</i>—Into a cup of boiling water, stir as
much ground flaxseed as it will “take up.” Spread on muslin; fold
edges over one inch or more, and cover with one layer of gauze.
Poultice is applied as hot as possible to the surface. Replace
in one hour.</p>

<p>A bread poultice is made by laying a slice of bread in a sieve, and
pouring hot water over it. It is placed on muslin and applied direct.</p>

<p>Poultices are not used as much as they were a number of years
ago, but stupes give such relief to pain in the abdomen that mention
should be made of the</p>

<p><i>Turpentine Stupe.</i>—To 1 pint boiling water, add 2 tsp. oil of turpentine.
Dip a large piece of flannel into this. Wring out by twisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in a towel—lay wet flannel in center of towel, fold edges of towel over
the flannel and twist ends of towel until the flannel is quite dry. Apply
hot! Cover with a large dry towel. Watch that it does not blister.
Anoint with vaseline or olive oil before applying stupe if skin is very
sensitive.</p>

<p>An easier method is to mix together equal parts oil of turpentine
and olive oil. Heat by setting the cup containing the mixture in
very hot water. Apply by rubbing. Cover with woolen cloth wrung
out of hot water, as described above.</p>

<div class="instruct">
<div class="sub">1. Tincture of Iodine.</div>

<p>(One ounce in a large-mouthed glass-stoppered bottle.)</p>

<p><i>This should be in every household</i> and every member above ten
years of age should know where it is kept. Any open wound or cut
should be immediately touched with this antiseptic.</p>

<p>Iodine is a <i>poison</i> if swallowed, but is the best household remedy
in cases of cuts or wounds. It should be applied to such injuries
immediately, for it destroys germs. Iodine may be applied direct
by pouring on wound; or with a small wad of absorbent cotton fastened
to a toothpick.</p>

<p>If iodine is swallowed by accident, give cornstarch and water, or
boiled starch, or bread softened in water.</p>

<p>To take iodine stains out of materials, use strong household
ammonia.</p>


<div class="sub">2. Aromatic Spirit of Ammonia.</div>

<p>(One ounce in glass-stoppered bottle.)</p>

<p>Dose:</p>



<ul class="booklist3"><li>Children, 10 drops in ¼ glass of water.</li>

<li>Grown people, ½ tsp. in ¼ glass of water.</li></ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Dose may be safely repeated every hour for several hours.</p>

<p>This is used for nervousness, headaches, indigestion, fainting, etc.</p>

<p>(Remember that an unconscious person cannot swallow, so do not
give an unconscious person medicine, for it may cause choking.)</p>


<div class="sub">3. Boric Acid Powder.</div>

<p>(One-half pound.)</p>

<p>Boric acid is not an acid, but a simple harmless alkali.</p>

<p>Useful in solution as a mouth wash; also for stings and for sore
eyes. Dissolve as much as possible in a cup of freshly boiled water.
For sore eyes, use in an eye-dropper or an eye-cup. It is both harmless
and safe. Sometimes the dry powder is dusted on the blistered surface
of a burn to dry blisters. Talcum powders contain a great deal of
boric acid, which is cooling and healing.</p>


<div class="sub">4. Compound Stearate of Zinc.</div>

<p>(One ounce.)</p>

<p>A simple, excellent dusting powder for skin irritations.</p>


<div class="sub">5. Pure Alcohol.</div>

<p>(One pint in glass-stoppered bottle. The glass stopper prevents
evaporation.)</p>

<p>Useful for bathing in case of fever—to reduce temperature. Dip
needle into alcohol before taking a splinter out—to “sterilize” or
remove germs from needle. If iodine becomes too strong because of
evaporation, add a little pure alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—“Wood” alcohol is a poison, sometimes causing blindness;
even used for bathing, it injures the eyes.</p>

<p>“Denatured” alcohol is a poison.</p>


<div class="sub">6. Lime Water.</div>

<p>(Five cents’ worth.)</p>

<p>Dose: 1 to 2 tbsp. or more in water or milk.</p>

<p>Used for acid indigestion, for poisoning from acids, and in making
carron oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<div class="sub">7. Carron Oil.</div>

<p>(One-half pint.)</p>

<p>Carron oil is excellent for burns. It may be purchased at the drug
store, or made by shaking together in a bottle equal parts of linseed
oil and lime water; for instance: one-quarter cup linseed oil, one
quarter cup lime water.</p>


<div class="sub">8. Epsom Salt.</div>

<p>(One-half pound.)</p>

<p>Useful as a laxative.</p>

<p>Dose: 1 tsp. to 1 tbsp. in a glass of water.</p>

<p>To relieve the skin in ivy poisoning, dissolve as much Epsom
salt as possible in a quarter cup boiled water. When cool, bathe skin
and allow to dry in the air.</p>


<div class="sub">9. Soda-Mint-and-Pepsin Tablets.</div>

<p>A simple remedy for indigestion.</p>


<div class="sub">10. Baking Soda (Bicarbonate of Soda).</div>

<p>(Two ounces in a box or glass.)</p>

<p>Useful in solution in case of scalds or burns, and stings of insects.</p>

<p>For indigestion: dose ½ tsp. in ½ glass hot water.</p>


<div class="sub">11. Household Ammonia.</div>

<p>(Label, “POISON.”)</p>

<p>In case of fainting, hold a little distance from patient’s nose.
Useful for stings of insects.</p>


<div class="sub">12. Adhesive (Zinc Oxide) Plaster.</div>

<p>(One yard, one-half inch wide.)</p>

<p>Useful for holding dressings in place or for fastening end of bandages,
etc.; for support in sprains in place of bandages; for strapping a cut,
but should <i>not</i> be used to <i>cover</i> a cut or wound.</p>


<div class="sub">13. Tube Vaseline.</div>

<p>Useful for burns, chapped hands, granulated eyelids. Do <i>not</i> put

<p>(Four ounces.)</p>

<p>Do not use on cuts! Cotton saturated with peroxide of hydrogen
will generally stop severe nosebleed. Used sometimes for burns.
Keep bottle in a <i>dark</i> closet; it deteriorates in the light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Peroxide of hydrogen is recommended by State Boards of
Health as a protection against Infantile Paralysis. Use as a spray for
nose and throat, or as a gargle, in the proportion of one part peroxide
to three parts water.</p>

<p>(Two ounces.)</p>

<p>Dose: Children, 1 to 2 tsp.; adults, 1 to 2 tbsp.</p>

<p>A mild purgative, clearing the intestines of undigested food in case

preparations may be given. There are one or two of these which are
not at all unpleasant to take. An easy method of taking castor oil:
hold a piece of ice in the mouth before taking; and after, rinse the
mouth with ice water.</p>


<div class="sub">17. Witch Hazel.</div>

<p>(Ten cents’ worth.)</p>

<p>Best applied in wet compress.</p>


<div class="sub">18. Essence, or Tincture, or Spirit of (Jamaica) Ginger.</div>

<p>(One ounce.)</p>

<p>Useful in small doses in bronchitis and asthma.</p>


<div class="sub">20. Spirit of Camphor.</div>

<p>It is useful for colds when they first appear. Dose: 2 drops on a

<div class="hangsection">
<p>Children ½ to 1 tsp.</p>

<p>For pain in abdomen, indigestion, diarrhea.</p>


<div class="sub">26. Picric Acid Gauze.</div>

<p>Useful for chilblains, and in “stupes.” See <a href="#READY_REFERENCE_LIST">Ready Reference List</a>,

<p>(Buy this at the drug store—it is not the kind used in paint.)</p>


<div class="sub">34. Aseptic (Sterile) Absorbent Cotton.</div>

<p>(Small package.)</p>

<p>“Aseptic” means clean, or free from germs. Keep clean in package,
opening end only as needed. Throw away all used cotton.</p>


<div class="sub">35. Sterile Gauze.</div>

<p>(Buy a one-yard package at the drug store. Keep it wrapped.)</p>

<p>“Sterile” means clean in a medical sense—free from germs. Do
not handle. Hands are seldom clean in a medical sense. Never use
old rags or pieces of handkerchiefs unless freshly laundered, but if
possible use sterile gauze for wrapping cuts or wounds.</p>


<div class="sub">36. Triangular Bandages.</div>

<p>The triangular bandage is the bandage used for first-aid emergencies.</p>

<p>The roller bandages are for more permanent use.</p>

<p>It is most convenient to have on hand one of the Red Cross First
Aid Outfits, the contents of which are so packed as to keep them free
from dust.</p>

<p>The simplest of these outfits contains all material necessary in
ordinary household accidents:</p>


<ul class="booklist3"><li>A triangular muslin bandage.</li>
<li>A gauze bandage.</li>
<li>Two safety pins.</li></ul>



<p>On the triangular bandage are printed pictures showing the way
in which it is used. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>To a gauze bandage a pad of gauze is sewed. This pad may be
tied over a wound without being touched with the hands.</p>

<p>The safety pins are to hold bandages in place, but a stitch is better.</p>


<div class="sub">37. Roller Bandages.</div>

<p>In addition to the above, in every medicine closet there should be:</p>

<div class="hangsection">
<p>Three gauze roller bandages, 1 inch wide (for bandaging fingers).</p>
<p>Three gauze roller bandages, 2½ inches wide (for bandaging arms, etc.).</p>
</div>

<p>It is best to buy roller bandages, wrapped ready for use, at the
drug store. Never use a wet bandage, for it shrinks as it dries, and
stops free circulation of the blood. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>.)</p>


<div class="sub">38. Rubber Ear Syringe.</div>


<div class="sub">39. Fountain Syringe.</div>




<div class="sub">40. Graduate Measuring Glass, marked with dosage—teaspoonful,

1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
